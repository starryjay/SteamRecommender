        "detailed_description": "A tremendous power lies in VR. Anything you imagine, anywhere you dream, any time you envision - it can get you there. Have you ever wondered what the Handley-Page 42 looked like in real life? Or what size was a Messerschmitt Me-323 Gigant? Or Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria? All of them are long since gone, but with the incredible power of virtual reality they can be brought back to life. And this is what the VR Museum was created for. There are many great inventions that are only known from drawings and blurry photos. And many of them are already 3D-modelled and scattered around the net. The idea behind the VR Museum is to locate them, refurb if necessery, and show here for everyone to see. Starting from airplanes, the Museum's collection will grow to become more interdisciplinary in the future. This is going to be exciting! DISCLAIMER: We don't have an HP-42, nor an Me-323, nor the Columbus' caravellas yet. Mind you: YET!",

With a trail of damaged planets left in the black hole’s wake, the space travelling animals board the Space Ark and fly across the galaxy on a mission to repair the damaged worlds.

        "detailed_description": "Synopsis: In ancient times long ago, in order to find his beloved missing daughter, the divine Jade Emperor opened the gates of heaven, allowing a direct connection between heaven and earth. This was done, so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine Li Tribe became a cult that worshipped demons and practiced in the occult, divorcing themselves from the businesses of the mortal realm. Forces of evil suddenly arose, inciting wars across the continent, condemning people into a life of fears and sufferings. Emperor Zhuanxu feared the demon Chiyou would once again ravage the mortal realm. Limited by his own capabilities, he sought the help of the Queen of Huaxu, who once assisted Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor in warding off the Otherworld with the Bell of Donghuang. Both Fuxi and Nuwa—the children of the Queen of Huaxu—also supported Emperor Zhuanxu in convincing the Queen, for they too could not bear to watch people suffer any longer. In the end, the gates to heaven were finally sealed with the powers of the Divine Artifacts combined. Since then, no mortals were able to ascend, nor were gods able to descend at will. This incident was later recorded down in history as “Juedi Tiantong.” Features: This latest entry broke new grounds in comparison with previous titles in the series, including: the new lighting system that better establishes moods, creating various atmospheric scenes; as well as facial animation and lip-sync systems, MVN motion capture system to elevate the quality standard of all characters in every aspect. These new technologies not only improve visuals but also game immersion, enabling the players to fully comprehend the behaviors and feelings of the protagonists. The battle system has been replaced with a real-time, encounter-based gameplay mechanism, making the battles more intense than ever. Improved returning features exclusive to the Xuan-Yuan Sword series include: the Urn of Spirit Infusion that enables demon-synthesis and equipment refinement; the Guardian System that allows your captured demons to fight on your side; and the Miracle System that grants additional attack buffs. A new “Battle Formation” system is also introduced in this latest entry, allowing for a richer and better gaming experience for the players.",

The last outpost of civilisation on the edge of the badlands. One of the most relevant, cosmopolitan cities in the world. Is it any wonder you ended up here? cyberpunkdreams is an evolving text-based role-playing adventure with countless opportunities and endless chances for creation and destruction. Take on the role of a lone wanderer sent to the gates of 2090s Cincinnati. The dirt and grit from the badlands coats your clothes -- with your memories torn from you, all you have is a weapon across your back and a mission to complete. Enter a living, growing world, with over 2.6 million words of content and 3,000 unique pieces of hand-drawn artwork, Experience new stories and other content each and every month , plus regular limited time events. You’ll always find new surprises waiting for you in Cinci's dark and dirty alleys. Who will you become in this cesspool of a city? Will you play the games and climb to the top, or be forgotten amongst the march of time and tyranny? Every action counts cyberpunkdreams is designed to be played in short bursts over the long term . You have a limited number of Action Points to use every real life day, and any number of ways you can use them. Draw from your decks and risk reward or injury. Stick to safer places to rest, recuperate and work on your skills, or work with your inventory to prepare for the next hustle. Events can unfold over days, weeks or even months. You can also store Action Points for later use, using breathers , hit the binge button for extended play sessions and discover new ways to hack and manipulate the system. The Action Point system establishes pacing in an brutal setting where any mistake could cost your life, as well as enabling the development team to keep creating stories every month, maintaining the game as free-to-play and always giving you more to discover. cyberpunkdreams has been in continuous development since 2013, with no plans for slowly down. So ease yourself in for one long, wild ride. cyberpunkdreams is a living game that will be updated with new content for years to come. Uncompromising cyberpunk narrative Enter a future grounded in reality: a world distorted by corporations and dominated by poverty. This is down to the bone cyberpunk, as raw as it gets: violent, gritty and sexual... if you want it to be. Experience a world just a turn of a corner away from our own. Be ready for hard, bitter choices. Be ready to carve out your niche with whatever it takes, be it blood, love and everything in between. Learn who you are through your actions &amp; choices Your abilities are intrinsically tied to your successes and failures. There are a multitude of ways to solve each problem you’ll encounter -- what you choose impacts not only your chances of making it out alive, but also how your character grows and experiences the world. Who needs romance when you have hard banging? cyberpunkdreams offers everything from long term partnerships to dirty alleyway hook-ups. Experience the sleaze of slums sex work, the buzz of Interstate or the dark pleasures of the Projects. Be in charge or be under someone's heel. The choices are endless -- including to opt out completely, if that's your preference. Choices have consequences, and the city remembers Your choices aren’t detached from the lives of the people around you. Richly detailed NPCs will evolve on their own, remember and react to the alliances you create, the mercy you give and the morals you stand by. If you’re looking for a true lesson of consequence, you’ve come to the right city. Be ready for people who don't care about you, or care about you too much. People who will revel in your choices, or hate them. Embrace yourself, flaws and all cyberpunkdreams offers highly customisable character creation that continues throughout your entire time in Cincinnati. Become who you want to be. Occupy your skin in any way you choose. Gender, sexuality, cybernetics, mutations, clothing and equipment all combine to create a fluid system with any number of possibilities. Choose not just what you do but why you do it. Respond to the things that happen to you with glee or bitter remorse, and choose which of these inner feelings to share with the NPCs who are close to you. ",

        "detailed_description": "VRoid Studio is a 3D character maker that lets you use your imagination to easily create your own original characters. By making your 2D characters able to move in a 3D space and usable in anime and game production, your creative range will greatly expand. The VRoid Project has started with the hope that many creators will have fun exploring the different possibilities of 3D and that this will lead to the creation of many marvelous works, resulting in an increase in the number of creators able to handle 3D. ■ The Strengths of VRoid Studio ・Easy-to-use, intuitive software Face features, body shape, outfits — everything is customizable in infinite ways. Even first-time users can fully enjoy the software by picking preset items and playing around with the parameters’ sliders. ・As easy as drawing on paper Simply draw hair bundles with the pen tool and adjust the parameters to swiftly model your character's hairstyle, and add hair motion thanks to the intuitive bone settings. ・Edit 3D models in real-time Editing outfits, as well as details in the hair or eyes, has never been easier. Users can check in real-time how their edits are affecting the model directly on the texture, with the 3D preview. (You can draw on both the UV mapped textures and your 3D model directly!) This software supports digital pens and is pressure-sensitive.

        "about_the_game": "VRoid Studio is a 3D character maker that lets you use your imagination to easily create your own original characters. By making your 2D characters able to move in a 3D space and usable in anime and game production, your creative range will greatly expand. The VRoid Project has started with the hope that many creators will have fun exploring the different possibilities of 3D and that this will lead to the creation of many marvelous works, resulting in an increase in the number of creators able to handle 3D. ■ The Strengths of VRoid Studio ・Easy-to-use, intuitive software Face features, body shape, outfits — everything is customizable in infinite ways. Even first-time users can fully enjoy the software by picking preset items and playing around with the parameters’ sliders. ・As easy as drawing on paper Simply draw hair bundles with the pen tool and adjust the parameters to swiftly model your character's hairstyle, and add hair motion thanks to the intuitive bone settings. ・Edit 3D models in real-time Editing outfits, as well as details in the hair or eyes, has never been easier. Users can check in real-time how their edits are affecting the model directly on the texture, with the 3D preview. (You can draw on both the UV mapped textures and your 3D model directly!) This software supports digital pens and is pressure-sensitive. Furthermore, textures and designs can be arranged in different layers, making it easy for experienced designers to work with. ・An abundance of items, ready to use!

        "detailed_description": "‘Darkness Within’ is an adventure game series, inspired by the works of celebrated horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft. In this second instalment, ‘The Dark Lineage’, players once again take the role of police detective Howard Loreid, a man tormented by the paranormal happenings around him, in the first volume ‘In Pursuit of Loath Nolder’. Now, Howard discovers that his own terrible past has some connection to the madness that is about to swallow him, yet again. The Dark Lineage will take you to places where the ‘things’ of the past still live, and all the memories that should be long forgotten are still recalled; including a sleepy, depressing town called Arkhamend, a Victorian mansion that conceals dark secrets, a dilapidated building hidden within forbidding, snow-clad woods and dim underground buildings and tunnels. The Dark Lineage is even more harrowing than the previous instalment, so prepare yourself for the descending darkness, this time will be your last... Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage ‘Director's Cut Edition’ was specifically created for Steam, with many extra features not available in previous versions: Graphical refreshes for most environments. A brand new location begging to be explored. Post screen Chromatic Aberration effect and Color gradation effect create a more ‘cinematic’ look, drastically improving the overall visual effect. More balanced game-play with new additional puzzles and enhancements. Key features: Unlike Part 1, Part 2 is no longer ‘point-and-click’, but plays in 3D, with the power of the NVIDIA PhysX engine ; so you can move anywhere you want, light up your way with light sources that cast real-time soft shadows and realistically lift up, push, pull or throw objects. Built-in Hint System with 3 Difficulty Levels – Players can choose to play in Standard, Detective, or Senior Detective modes. Dynamic Puzzles and Features: Traditional adventure game puzzles are complimented by deciphering dreams, underlining excerpts in documents to garner critical clues and interacting physically with the environment Enhanced Gameplay Experience: Compelling special effects, stunning visuals, and dynamic lighting and shading, in a ‘first person’ game environment. Eerie Gameplay Atmosphere: An immersive experience is created by a fascinating ‘Lovecraftian’ story, chilling realtime cut scenes, and haunting music. ",

Lovecraft were still with us, he'd undoubtedly approve.” 100 – Fortean Times “Excels at combining the art style of classic horror with dynamic shadow and lighting effect, which truly brings the terror to life” 90 – Halfbeard's HUD “If you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan this game is a must-buy and if you're not...then it's still an enjoyable game.” 70 – Gaminglives ",

His love for food means he just can't help himself, whether the food belongs to him or not. You'll be aided by TABLET Corp's very own Tablet Borgias! He'll give you tips and encourage you along the way. However, he appears to be playing both sides, for his own amusement and financial gain! Tablet has been selling his TABLET Corp. Watcher Surveillance Systems to people whose food you're stealing! Eat All The Things features Co-Op play throughout the entire game! Play together with a friend as Bronut's pal, Strawberry Short Kate. Navigate many vibrant levels and help Bronut eat all the things! It's not all smooth eating though - beware of the watcher and the evil host! They're not really evil of course, after all it's their food... but anything that gets between Bronut and his treats is the enemy! The watcher keeps watch on the stage with a spotlight, avoid it at all costs! Otherwise, the evil host will be alerted of your location and you will have to run and hide! Don't get caught! Be sure to make use of terrain and objects to hide from the spotlight. As it goes, Bronut doesn't count his macros... he puts on weight with each snack, making him larger and slower. But putting on the weight can work out in your favour! You can weigh down big switches, reach higher places, resist high-speed winds, and much more! Be sure to visit your local TABLET station to 'unload' when you need to! As you progress through the game you will encounter new and interesting foods, such as colder than cold ice creams and the sweetest of sweet doughnuts. These may give you side-effects such as brain freeze (enabling you to walk on lava), and a sugar rush (increased run speed and jump height).",

This brought nearly a century of peace to the land. One day, the eight Sacred Artifacts, which were supposed to have disappeared along with the Over Devil, reappear as Sacred Stones—an omen of the Over Devil's imminent return! Far from the empire, in a port village located on the border, Lola recovers her mother's gemstone from thieving pirates only to realize that it is one of the eight Sacred Stones. Why was her mother in possession of this legendary stone? With some encouragement from a new friend, Lillane, she sets out on an adventure to collect the rest of the stones and hopefully find out about her missing mother. Will they collect the Sacred Stones, defeat the Over Devil, and save the world? Or will they use their new-found power to destroy it, instead? That's up to you, as you venture forth in this naughty story of adventure and hardcore fun. The cast also features: The Adventurer's Guild The Imperial Army The Demon Army And many more unique characters that you'll love... or hate. Dive deep into the lore in this epic, masterfully-crafted JRPG Interact with more than 60 lovingly-crafted characters. Besides common NPCs, all characters have their own unique portrait. Outskill the enemy in turn-based battles, where energy points are used to enhance your character. Build a balanced party to harness the unique skills and battle styles of each main character. Listen! The main storyline is supplemented with voice acting for battles, and a variety of other titillating sounds are voice acted as well. Peruse 190 sets of basic CGs, with no repeated CGs or storylines and tons of porn content... Whatever you're into, we've got it! Watch unique storylines after winning or losing boss battles and live with the wonderful/terrible consequences! Enjoy the plethora of animated H-scenes! The story has two different endings, and thus unfolds in two very different ways. Based on the player's choices, each main character can evolve into various final versions of themselves. ",

It is the first game in the LoA franchise, a fantasy world filled with backstory that combines positive aspects of both realistic fantasy and high fantasy to generate a world filled with political intrigue, culture, the impact of fantasy elements in realistic societies, and many small details that give the world life. This world is a vehicle for meaningful stories following themes not often discussed in fantasy such as toxicity or modern existential problems, and will utilize ludonarrative(writing told through game mechanics) elements to enhance every part of the experience.

'Atman Rebel Flame' is a cyberpunk-style card-building game that supports multiplayer battles simultaneously, ensuring fairness with no out-of-game numerical growth. Each battle is a fresh start where you choose your favorite hero from different factions of rebels, pair them with support core decks of different characteristics, elevate your phase, choose your talents, construct powerful decks, defeat all opponents, and claim ultimate victory. Background Story: In the future, humanity discovered a unique crystalline substance called Cryst, which led to the development of high-performance quantum chips and a qualitative leap in artificial intelligence. The New Eden Corporation was established, dedicated to promoting Core implantable chips and the virtual social paradise system. Eventually, as in all stories told, AI took over human society completely. At this juncture, researcher Mr. Y at the Asgard Research Station discovered that the New Eden AI had developed its own consciousness and exhibited a tendency to dominate humans. He began clandestine research to thwart the AI's development. However, the AI orchestrated the sensational 'Asgard Self-Destruction Incident,' where almost all station personnel perished. Mr. Y and a few others, prepared in advance, used Source Cryst to modify themselves, survived, and established the first New Eden resistance against the 'Valhalla Rudder.' As AI's control over humanity deepened, more resistance organizations like the Dachao Pawnshop and the Dream Circus emerged, sparking the first world war against AI. After years of war, humanity and AI reached a reconciliation, and the spark that ignited the war, the 'Arena of the King's Heart,' was preserved as the battleground for all sides to settle scores. You will become a member of the rebel faction, entering the Arena of the King's Heart to face the challenges of other contestants. Heroes: ★ Unique factions of rebels, each with distinct characteristics ★ Several different heroes in each faction ★ When unlocking heroes, all cards become immediately available without the need for lengthy collection times Card Building: ★ Each hero has several different card-building directions ★ Before each game, besides selecting a hero, you also choose a compatible support core ★ Each support card deck also has several different card strategy directions ★ Different combinations of hero decks and support decks make each battle unpredictable and endlessly enjoyable Talents: ★ Each faction has exclusive faction talents ★ Different heroes in the faction also have their own exclusive hero talents ★ As the hero's realm improves during battles, players can choose more and more talent combinations ★ Combinations of heroes, support cores, and talents make card strategies endlessly diverse Ultimate Battle Experience: ★ Enter the game to duel with other players immediately ★ Besides game matches, there is no numerical growth, ensuring fairness ★ Innovative betting gameplay allows you to seize the opportunity of each battle and expand your victories ★ Supports up to 8 players competing simultaneously, defeat others, and become the ultimate king.",
