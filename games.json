        "reviews": "“The game’s fun. Better than some games that only focus on graphics and shit. Heck it’s even better than WWE2K20. If you played that game, you’ll know what I mean.” - AJStylesPL1 “I'm a fan of the combined moves you included, like the sprint-attack &amp; counterattack after blocking (which has very satisfying audiovisual feedback when you land it, well done)! The animation in general is the most charming aspect of the game.” - squashysquish ",

Utilize various kinds of weapons, armor, engines, wheels, and propulsion systems. Take air drag into account since every element has an impact on a vehicle’s handling and its capabilities. Expand upon your vessel’s design to complete a mission or start over from a blank slate. Construct fighters, transporters, tanks, destroyers, or blimps and savor your creative freedom. Use different kinds of guns and plating to duke it out with hostile vehicles. Revel in the destruction caused by your weapons with fully simulated projectiles. Protect yourself with angled armor which might reflect enemy shots. Be careful not to overexert your engines or else they might catch on fire. Make good use of physics and rain destruction upon your enemies. Take pleasure in exploring a vast and interesting world filled with adventure. Launch a full-scale invasion and conquer entire islands. Delve into the world of a single-player campaign and onto an arena filled with enemies. Enjoy limitless freedom in sandbox mode. Go where combat is the most intense and take part in massive battles, unleashing your vehicle’s full potential. Learn the extent of your creations’ capabilities and face increasing challenges. Figure out your enemies’ battle plan and spot the weaknesses of their vessels. Fight alongside allies or solo. Features Advanced destruction simulation, vehicles can be cut in half. Projectiles with their own ballistics, penetration, and ricochet mechanics. Simulation of aerodynamics, buoyancy, fires, and flooding. Vehicles constructed from many different materials, paintable armors with various levels of thickness. Vehicles with various ranges of visibility and detection radii. Creative mode where you can build any vehicle you want. Integrated Steam workshop to share your creativity. Destruction The most important part of any ship is its core block, there can be only one of this type and its destruction will annihilate the whole vehicle. Every block must have a connection to the core. Each element has its own hit points, level of fire resistance, ability to resist impact and explosion. Some of them can also be flooded or lose their lift power. Every destroyed element has an impact on a vessel's combat capabilities - strategic block placement can improve your vehicle’s survivability and efficiency. Weapons Each weapon is a separate object with its own logic and physics systems. Before shooting, a weapon checks if it doesn’t don't hit or collide with its own vehicle. Weapons types include many variants of artillery, missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and crazy close combat weapons. One of the unique weapons is a harpoon that can grab and pull enemies or pull its own vehicle to the ground. Physics The shape and size of the vehicles' hull affects their air and water drag. Vessels with an angled, aerodynamic hull are faster than those that look like a brick. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of which should be balanced with the center of mass. Water has realistic wave simulation, there is also wind that can be used by sails. Mechanics The game has realistic gun ballistics and armor penetration mechanics; angled surfaces offer better protection from projectiles and can cause them to ricochet. Most blocks can be made using different materials that have different weights and other properties. Enemy vehicles can behave differently, depending on what weapons they have installed and what their goals are.",

This is my first animated project and I want it to be free of charge. It was rather hard to withdraw from the pixel art but the result exceeded my expectations.

        "detailed_description": "This is an exciting medieval adventure in which the hero, The Caped Crusader, takes on the King's Guard in an effort to give back to the poor the gold coins the King has unfairly collected from poor tenants. During the game, one and then increasingly more members of the King's Guard are seen travelling through the medieval forest with the bags of gold they have collected from the poor tenants. The Caped Crusader is watching their advances in the distance. When the King's Guard stop to rest at their various campfires, they place a bag of gold on the ground beside the open fire. This is when The Caped Crusader must advance and grab the bag of gold that is on the ground at the guard's feet. But The Caped Crusader needs to be careful in his advance. If he is seen by members of the King's Guard, the guards will attack and potentially seriously injure The Caped Crusader. If The Caped Crusader is seriously injured he is forced to retreat and recommence the game at another time. What level The Caped Crusader can recommence depends upon how many bags of gold he has successfully collected before being seriously injured. The total number of bags of gold that The Caped Crusader was able to collect appears on the screen when The Caped Crusader is seriously injured. The Caped Crusader's goal in each game is to take as many bags of gold as he can from the King's Guard so that they can be given back to the poor tenants. To collect a bag of gold, The Caped Crusader merely needs to step over it. Each time The Caped Crusader is successful in getting a bag of gold The Caped Crusader must return to his original campsite. The bag of gold will drop automatically when The Caped Crusader approaches his tent. The Caped Crusader must drop his gold before going out into the woods again to get more gold. This is how bags of gold are tallied. The player can only advance to the next level when the necessary number of bags of gold have been collected by The Caped Crusader and been placed by him in the tent at the original campsite. Français: Il s'agit d'une aventure médiévale passionnante dans laquelle le héros, le chevalier à la cape, affronte la garde du roi dans le but de rendre aux pauvres les pièces d'or que le roi a injustement collectées auprès des locataires pauvres. Au cours du jeu, on voit un, puis de plus en plus de membres de la garde du roi se déplacer dans la forêt avec les sacs d'or qu'ils ont collectés auprès des pauvres paysans. Le chevalier observe leurs avancées au loin. Lorsque les gardes du roi s'arrêtent pour se reposer à leurs différents feux de camp, ils déposent un sac d'or sur le sol, à côté du feu. C'est à ce moment-là que le chevalier doit avancer et s'emparer du sac d'or qui se trouve par terre aux pieds des gardes. Mais le chevalier doit être prudent dans son avancée. S'il est vu par des membres de la garde du roi, les gardes l'attaqueront et risqueront de le blesser gravement. Si le chevalier est gravement blessé, il est contraint de battre en retraite et de reprendre le jeu à un autre moment. Le niveau auquel le chevalier peut reprendre le jeu dépend du nombre de sacs d'or qu'il a réussi à collecter avant d'être gravement blessé. Le nombre total de sacs d'or que le chevalier a pu collecter apparaît à l'écran lorsque qu'il est est gravement blessé. L'objectif du chevalier dans chaque partie est de prendre le plus grand nombre de sacs d'or possible à la garde du roi afin de les rendre aux pauvres. Pour récupérer un sac d'or, le chevalier n'a qu'à l'enjamber. Chaque fois que le chevalier réussit à obtenir un sac d'or, il doit retourner à son campement d'origine. Le sac d'or tombera automatiquement lorsque le chevalier s'approchera de sa tente. Le chevalier doit déposer son or avant de repartir dans les bois pour en récupérer d'autres. C'est ainsi que les sacs d'or sont comptabilisés. Le joueur ne peut passer au niveau suivant que lorsque le nombre nécessaire de sacs d'or a été collecté par le chevalier et placé par lui dans la tente du campement d'origine. Deutch: Dies ist ein spannendes mittelalterliches Abenteuer, in dem der Held, der Kreuzritter mit Umhang, gegen die königliche Garde antritt, um den Armen die Goldmünzen zurückzugeben, die der König zu Unrecht von den armen Mietern einkassiert hat. Im Laufe des Spiels sieht man erst ein und dann immer mehr Mitglieder der königlichen Garde mit den Säcken voller Gold, die sie von den armen Mietern eingesammelt haben, durch den mittelalterlichen Wald ziehen. Der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang beobachtet ihr Vorankommen in der Ferne. Wenn die königliche Garde an ihren verschiedenen Lagerfeuern rastet, legen sie einen Beutel mit Gold auf den Boden neben dem offenen Feuer. In diesem Moment muss der Kreuzritter mit den Kapuzen vorrücken und sich den Beutel mit dem Gold schnappen, der vor den Füßen der Wache auf dem Boden liegt. Aber der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang muss bei seinem Vormarsch vorsichtig sein. Wenn er von Mitgliedern der königlichen Garde gesehen wird, greifen die Wachen an und verletzen den Kreuzritter mit Kapuze möglicherweise schwer. Wenn der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze schwer verletzt wird, muss er sich zurückziehen und das Spiel zu einem anderen Zeitpunkt wieder aufnehmen. Welches Level der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze neu beginnen kann, hängt davon ab, wie viele Goldsäcke er erfolgreich gesammelt hat, bevor er schwer verletzt wurde. Die Gesamtzahl der Goldsäcke, die der Caped Crusader sammeln konnte, wird auf dem Bildschirm angezeigt, wenn der Caped Crusader schwer verletzt ist. Das Ziel des Kreuzritters ist es, in jedem Spiel so viele Goldsäcke wie möglich von der königlichen Garde zu erbeuten, damit sie an die armen Pächter zurückgegeben werden können. Um einen Goldsack einzusammeln, muss der Caped Crusader nur über ihn steigen. Jedes Mal, wenn der Kreuzritter mit dem Kapuzenpulli einen Sack Gold ergattert hat, muss er zu seinem ursprünglichen Lagerplatz zurückkehren.

Privacy and Security This software doesn't require drivers or administrative privileges to work, and it doesn't write any data to the file system or Windows registry (apart from the optional user-settings file). It doesn't access the internet and can be used with Steam in offline mode. It is adequate for use in secure environments and complies with all data protection regulations, including CCPA, HIPAA, COPPA and the European GDPR. Current Limitations Some multiplayer games with aggressive anti-cheat are currently incompatible. Fixing this is work-in-progress. GUI is not available for OpenGL games (framerate control features still work). Latency control is not enabled for Vulkan games. May be enabled later, depending on player interest. GPU status and overclocking features only available for AMD and NVIDIA cards. Some status data may be missing (e.g. old graphics cards don't have a memory temperature sensor). Overclocking has some limitations described in the manual (mostly driver-related). Native UWP apps not supported (some apps in the Windows Store). Additional features are available under NDA.

Privacy and Security This software doesn't require drivers or administrative privileges to work, and it doesn't write any data to the file system or Windows registry (apart from the optional user-settings file). It doesn't access the internet and can be used with Steam in offline mode. It is adequate for use in secure environments and complies with all data protection regulations, including CCPA, HIPAA, COPPA and the European GDPR. Current Limitations Some multiplayer games with aggressive anti-cheat are currently incompatible. Fixing this is work-in-progress. GUI is not available for OpenGL games (framerate control features still work). Latency control is not enabled for Vulkan games. May be enabled later, depending on player interest. GPU status and overclocking features only available for AMD and NVIDIA cards. Some status data may be missing (e.g. old graphics cards don't have a memory temperature sensor). Overclocking has some limitations described in the manual (mostly driver-related). Native UWP apps not supported (some apps in the Windows Store). Additional features are available under NDA. Send a message for technical demonstrations.",

Key Features First-person stealth and survival. Procedurally-generated British landscape. Five biomes to explore: castle, industrial, rural, mountainous, and fenland. Infinite replayability in a sandbox world. Powerful, brutal AI that becomes tougher as you play. Tea and biscuits. Foliage-based stealth system. Scavenge to survive. Play as Sir or Madam. Relentless Britishness. Every Game Unique! Sir, You Are Being Hunted is set on a mysterious archipelago generated procedurally by you, and therefore unique to each game you play. You can define your own islands, each one created in moments by our rather clever British Countryside Generator. These islands are then populated by a raving aristocracy of murderous robots, their robot hounds, and worse. You job is simply to survive, and get home. You're not entirely alone, though: The disembodied voice of Walters, your butler, will help you and offer advice. Ultimate AI Threat Sir's AI is one of the toughest in stealth, and as an open-world game, it's unique in its field. The robots are some of the most aggressive and intelligent game enemies you will ever experience, and will pursue you even after losing sight of you. Expect to be hunted! The Most British Of Games Sir, You Are Being Hunted is set in a parallel Britain, complete with bleak villages, rocky highlands, bramble-filled woodland, decrepit farms, and crumbling post-industrial landscapes. Made with the remarkable power of our British Landscape Generator, these landscapes are enormously evocative and teeming with detail. Take time to explore, and find that vital hidden flask of tea!

The characters are voiced by hospital play therapists and constant feedback was being provided by the hospital staff.” Unity Connect “Virtual Reality technologies allow anyone, to be anywhere, with anything, at any time. Yesterday the idea of having a linear accelerator that children could practice in was unfathomable in public health services, but tomorrow that will be reality… it's truly amazing.” Auckland District Health Board “The project aims to improve the overall hospital experience for child patients, and reduce the need for medication to manage anxiety, achieving better clinical outcomes.” AR/VR Garage ",

Navigate as fast as you can through the level to reach the beacons or risk facing squads of enemies already waiting for you; then use your weapons and evasive maneuvers to take them down in bright colorful explosions. An electric neon, colorful yet sparse look is the inspiration for all the elements in the game; the setting, the player ships, enemies, visual effects and music take notes from simple vector art and electronic music. Voxel Blast was created as a love letter to 3D dogfighting games and also space shooters, in an attempt to find a common ground between those two kinds of games. In Voxel Blast you can choose one of three ships with different weapons, yet all of them very focused in providing a satisfying dog-fighting style and movement. The game has three modes to learn and test the skills necessary for the player to succeed: the Challenge mode, the Survival mode and the Arcade. The Challenge mode consist in a series of courses marked trough navigation beacons with limited time to reach them; this mode teaches the player the necessary skills to fly and navigate the spaceships in a safer environment that the arcade with lower stakes overall, but with a focus on high speed precise flying. The Survival mode presents the player with an arena much like the ones in the Arcade mode, but in a three-lives endless score-attack combat with a constant flow of a varied mix of enemies; in the survival mode the player can see all the enemies he might find in the Arcade and develop ways to fight them, including the interactions between different compositions of enemies. The Arcade mode combines the combat and navigation in stages comprised of sets of flying sections and fighting gauntlets, where the number of destroyed enemies and the time taken to complete count towards the final score. The game features gamepad support for analog direct input and some flightsticks, but it has been designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard using a system that tries to reproduce the nuance of using a stick to control the roll and pitch of the spaceship. This makes the control of the ship one of the main skills to master in the game, along with the speed control, positional engagement of enemies and management of special projectiles.",

Then it's time to take a relaxing trip to the DreamTank, a sweeping musical journey that takes you through randomly generated alien worlds in an interaction-light VR experience. DreamTank contains ten different DreamTracks--the musical score that drives the visuals--with each experience beginning with simple shapes and a muted color palette, and then as the DreamTrack plays on, the worlds become more vivid, the shapes more complex, and the colors more vibrant. Watch the sun rise and set over alien worlds, see massive objects float through the sky above you, and watch distant comets burn through the night sky backlit by stars and planets--each world a randomly generated snapshot that will be unique to your experience! DreamTank is an interaction-light experience! DreamTank was created to be something that was observed, something that was relaxing and something that would inspire the imagination. This means that there is no teleportation, no weapons, no gravity guns or terrain manipulators, and this is by design! DreamTank is the kind of experience you would want to do when you don't want to do anything, just watch and observe the worlds it makes for you! When you're wanting some more VR, but don't want to work up a sweat, give DreamTank a try. You never know what you might see. Key Features: Randomly and procedurally generated worlds and visuals unique to each playthrough Screenshot capturing for later viewing and sharing of the worlds you discover Sequence pauser - if you like the world that was created, stay in it as long as you like Ten different musical DreamTracks, each with a unique mood and pace After playing through one experience, unlock the DreamTrack selector to choose which track you'd like to play Support for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (with and without Touch controllers), gamepads and keyboard Important Performance notes: DreamTank uses significant GPU resources to render the beautiful worlds you will encounter. Although DreamTank works on a AMD RX480 and Nvidia GTX 980ti, for the best experience we recommend at least a GTX 1070 with 6GB of RAM or more. If you have a system that struggles to play other VR games, then DreamTank is not for you! High-Resolution Screenshots: To enable 4k screenshots, press the letter H on the keyboard to toggle high-resolution screen captures. Be warned that this takes a powerful GPU, and that rendering may be momentarily paused while the screenshot is saved.",

        "detailed_description": "RotoBrix is falling blocks, match-3, puzzle game, where you try to match as many blocks as you can before filling the play field. If the Brix pile up too high and a new stack cannot be spawned then it’s game over. Maneuver the falling stack of three Brix and rotate their positions within the stack to set up matches. Match three or more Brix vertically or horizontally to score points and reduce the Brix Left counter. When the counter hits zero, you move to the next level. Pass five levels to get to the next stage. Each of the first nine stages of the game add new Brix and abilities. Match four or more Brix in one move to earn charges for abilities you can use to make your job easier: Bomb: causes a large explosion that destroys the blocks in the middle of the play field Hourglass: temporarily slows time Randomizer: randomizes colors of the blocks on the play field At higher stages, beware of the unmatchable carbon fiber Brix. They will not form matches and will clutter up the play field. However, a bomb can destroy them. Choose from four difficulty levels to change the speed of the game and the size of the scores. The top ten high scores are saved on the High Scores page. Play at a higher difficulty level to get bigger scores. Scores also get larger as you advance stages. Once you reach a stage you may use the Stage Select feature to start at that stage without having to play through the lower stages. For our color blind friends, or if you just want to play with a different style of Brix, turn on Color Blind Mode to add symbols to the Brix.

If the Brix pile up too high and a new stack cannot be spawned then it’s game over. Maneuver the falling stack of three Brix and rotate their positions within the stack to set up matches. Match three or more Brix vertically or horizontally to score points and reduce the Brix Left counter. When the counter hits zero, you move to the next level. Pass five levels to get to the next stage. Each of the first nine stages of the game add new Brix and abilities. Match four or more Brix in one move to earn charges for abilities you can use to make your job easier: Bomb: causes a large explosion that destroys the blocks in the middle of the play field Hourglass: temporarily slows time Randomizer: randomizes colors of the blocks on the play field At higher stages, beware of the unmatchable carbon fiber Brix. They will not form matches and will clutter up the play field. However, a bomb can destroy them. Choose from four difficulty levels to change the speed of the game and the size of the scores. The top ten high scores are saved on the High Scores page. Play at a higher difficulty level to get bigger scores. Scores also get larger as you advance stages. Once you reach a stage you may use the Stage Select feature to start at that stage without having to play through the lower stages. For our color blind friends, or if you just want to play with a different style of Brix, turn on Color Blind Mode to add symbols to the Brix. The game also features dozens of animated backgrounds, and electronic music.",

D'arc's moment of reckoning arrives and his Masters put him to the test.

The 12 beings that rose from the void shared their powers to create Traum and lived peacefully amongst their descendants. The descendants prospered under the blessings of the 12 beings who were now worshipped as gods. But one day, an unexpected being, Evil God Serpens came into existence. Main Features UNCHANGED - The fun of Hack &amp; Slash comes from annihilating countless enemies at once. As a genre where character growth is tied to devastating enemies to obtain new items, the focus was set upon the proposition to 'gain strength after wiping out enemies' during development. Stirring away from the typical growth system, players will be able to enjoy completing their own unique builds. UNDEFINED - Freedom to Select Various Combat Styles There are no defined classes in UNDECEMBER. Once a character is created after customization, players will be able to freely change around gears and skills based on personal playstyle. Builds are divided into Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence types, but there are no gear or combination restrictions. Players are free to cast magic with a sword or summon minions with a bow, or create any new unique builds of their own. UNLIMITED - Infinite Combination of Skills Runes are classified by Skill and Link Runes. Link Runes assist the effects of Skill Runes. These Runes can be equipped in a separate space called the Rune Cast, and can be obtained through farming or by completing quests. Each Rune has levels and grades, which can be upgraded with materials obtained through farming. UNSTOPPABLE - Never-ending Choice of Contents - Acts: The main scenario of the game. - Chaos Dungeon: End-game content available after completing the main scenario. - Boss Raid: A cooperative content with up to 8 players. - Crusade of Glory: A free-for-all PvP content. - Guild: Gather up to 50 members to gain exclusive benefits such as Guild Buffs.

WARNING: This is extremely difficult, if not impossible level to complete. In addition, version 0.3.5 includes the following updates: Rumble--literally feel the impact of getting shot! Pause menu with option to restart the scene, go back to the mainmenu scene, or change settings. Settings screen that provides options to turn off rumble, rotation speed, and dynamic rest frames for those that are immune to motion sickness. Lots of miscellaneous tweaks. About the Game By combining the pulse-pounding action of time-trials with fast, fluid VR gameplay, NextGen Games has crafted one of the most ADDICTINGLY REPLAYABLE VR experiences yet released. Beat the clock and squash the alien scum in this frenetic VR shooter. The year is 2027. As a contractor for NextGen Games, it is your job to pilot a remote telepresence drone via your trusted VR headset. Fortunately work has picked up due to a recent alien invasion. The United Nations has hired the firm to secure the planet Earth, and rid it of alien infestation. The fate of the world is in your hands and your headset. Good luck. The core design of VR Apocalypse revolves around the following major tenets. Comfort = Immersion. First-person shooters are not normally a good idea for VR due to presence-breaking VR-sickness. However, we think we’ve conquered it with this title by utilizing a new technique we’ve dubbed a “dynamic rest frame”. Classic first-person shooting/traversal has never felt this good in a VR headset. Replay Value is king. Forget short, one-off experiences. VR Apocalypse is a highly replayable, arcade style shooter with randomized elements that will keep players coming back for more. Arcade Leaderboards . Compete against friends to see who can get the best possible times on our customized leaderboards. Exploding Aliens . Because who doesn't like watching aliens go boom? ",

Randomized Arenas Randomly generated arenas have multiple gates from which enemies may emerge at any time, keeping you on your toes. Dynamic Defense Creative usage of explosive barrels and automatic turrets stack the odds of survival in your favor depending on how you place them in the arena.",

Frame Rate Conversion 3D output is generated at 24 FPS by default, but Stream to 3D can support output frame rates at up to 120 FPS, with a range of standard frame rates in between; 30, 48 and 60. Frame rate conversion is a resource intensive activity, but on a modest 3060 GPU based laptop (for example), real-time conversion frame rates of 48 FPS on 1080p input with HSBS 3D output is quite achievable. Obviously, unless you have a beast of a machine, the higher frame rates would be more appropriate to apply in off-line conversion. Seamless Integration with VR Headsets Stream to 3D makes it effortless to enjoy your favourite content in stunning 3D on VR headsets. Simply download the Stream to 3D PC Windows application, open your 2D video file (with support for a wide range of formats, including .mkv and .mp4), and witness your videos transform into breathtaking 3D experiences.

The game is totally new idea of a 2D Brick Breaker game 'originally called breakout' which is all full of fun specially in this astonished PC game where you need to break not just bricks but a bunch of targets and enemies. Military play style giving you action and a little bit of stress because it is a mix of shooting, breaking, destroying and fighting invaders using more than 25 Powerups and 10 major weapons. All of these powers made the playing of this game is a unique close to realism. It is a war game with so many missions that you have to accomplish using a shooting killer ball. Easy or hard missions? This depends on the mode of your playing and of course the game challenges. The free Demo version consists of 10 levels (the final version has 100 levels). Go SHOOT 'EM UP now. The Mission: With action and fun together, use the ball and bunch of weapons to destroy enemies. Let's find out who is the Uncatchable Homer! But, as a starter, enjoy the feeling that you are in a real war mission, all you need to do is to kill anything you face until you get to the last target. This target could be a brick, wall, ball, enemy, plane, monster, weapon, or a hidden things. The name Homers goes back to the carrier pigeon that was used in wars for the purposes of secret correspondence, which in fact led to saving many human lives. And sometimes achieving actual victories. Features: One of the most interesting features in Uncatchable Homers game is that it will give you fun by enjoying the 3D sound effects and human voices which are the main reason to make you feel that you are on a real war. Other features are the many levels and puzzles beside using a great unique Powerups and Weapons to destroy enemies. These powers will help you accomplish missions. We included a time limit missions to save these homers before getting catch by enemy. Please don't make them do that, save their lives and save the solders lives too. Different levels with different skills needed to destroy targets, shooting and killing enemies. With all of that you will feel the life of solder in a real war mission with perfect skill of shooting and sniper killing. Some levels will give you the opportunity to shoot only one bullet. Make it a headshot. Try the Demo version to find out some of great features. What else? If you like military and war games beside destroying objects with lots of fun and emotions, then this game is made for you. The more progress you make with finishing or accomplishing missions you will get new more Powerups and Weapons that can be easily use with only two mouse clicks. Some of the powers will start automatically when you collect them, this also will make you feel the power of a great army. You can enjoy the hearing of the 3D sounds and voices if you are using good headphones, but also regular ones will do the job. We included so many human sounds which are actually the amazing part in this game. When you decide to replay the same level (to get a new high score for example), you will find new different voices every time you replay the level. Beside all of that, you will get great steam achievements by finishing some levels or breaking time limit missions. Expected Full Release? We are working hard to deliver the final version of this game by the June 2023. Some of the final touches in the design, sounds and modification of some levels to bring the greatest fun for you. If you love old school Atari breakout or brick breaker games, Arcade games, Arkanoid new video games, and shooting games with features of fighting with more than 70 enemies using punch of weapons, then standby for the upcoming game Uncatchable Homers Master. Hope you enjoy the game, GOOD Luck. UniMeta Games Website: ",

Create your own character based on 1920's archetypes and carve a path through a broken and mysterious world. Your desperate battle against forces beyond comprehension will haunt you until the end. Physical combat will be challenging, spellcasting will have dire consequences, and your sanity will be strained to the breaking point by unknown abominations. Sometimes the best solution will be to flee what lurks beyond the threshold. Features: A hand drawn 2D world reflecting Lovecraft's themes of cosmic horror and dread. Enemies, environments and storylines inspired by Lovecraft’s iconic original works. Take part in quests inspired by your favorite stories and see them play out according to your own decisions and role-playing style. Choose from 8 main character Archetypes, each with its own origin backstory and specialties. A host of weird companions will accompany you on your ill-starred journey: the lonely, antediluvian 'Outsider', a fallen soldier of the Great War reanimated by Herbert West. Recruit these and other outlandish beings to your crew. Your character's Sanity and mental state will influence dialogue options. Mental illness comes with advantages as well as hindrances. Sometimes it pays to be mad in a world gone mad! Stygian's Belief System determines how your characters cope with the warped reality of the new Arkham, as well as the rate at which they regenerate lost Sanity. Belief Systems also offer unique dialogue options, expanding the breadth of role-playing possibilities. A new kind of spell system which sometimes takes more than it gives. Being a master of the occult is not as simple as flinging colored missiles from your fingertips. The black magic of Stygian is potent but may cost you your mind, your health, and possibly even much more. Strategic, turn-based combat from a 2D perspective, similar to the classic Heroes of Might and Magic games. The struggle in Stygian is not to save the world, for that battle is lost already. Pursue your own goals in these end times: salvation, vendetta, or perhaps something darker. ",

Built in the Unreal engine, this first-person, room-scale VR experience lets users take control of a variety of weapons and tools to fight off endless waves of evil robotic elves. As Santa, users must move around the environment to set up defenses and dodge attacks to beat back the onslaught. 'Tis the season! KEY FEATURES: - Step into Nick’s boots to make a last stand in this room-scale interactive VR experience. - Hone your skills with the game tutorial. - Select the level of difficulty from three options. - Face crushing waves of deranged killer robo-elves each with different abilities. - Use the “Santa’s Little Helper” suction gun alongside your trusty mallet to turn everything around you into a weapon. - Board up windows to fortify your defenses between waves. - Maintain your workshop’s energy source by collecting battery cells dropped by defeated elves to power the generator. - Christmas Easter Eggs (oh, the irony) abound! - Save the holidays. Well, you can’t... But you can hold out as long as possible. - Nick is compatible with the HTC Vive BACKGROUND: The year is 2027. Civil unrest grips the North Pole. Santa Claus, a Rockefeller-ian captain of industry and a figure of hope and progress, has fallen on hard times. His once insurmountable manufacturing empire has given up massive ground to the dual-pronged threat of overseas production and digital distribution. In order to keep up with a changing manufacturing landscape, Santa decided to automate his workshop by installing a mechanized, robotic production system led by an Artificial Intelligence named P.A.L. (Polar Algorithmic Computer). For the first few months, everything seemed copacetic. Then came an efficiency test… that Santa, by dint of being flesh and blood as opposed to mechanical marvel, inevitably failed. P.A.L. repurposed the once-peaceful robo-elf manufacturing arm into an army bent on assassination, and set out to wipe Santa from the face of the Earth. Why? To maximize profits, of course! Enter Nick—Santa Claus’ badass survivalist alter ego. Nick’s on the run, evading and fighting P.A.L.’s robot forces as he traverses the Polar wasteland. Fueled by weapons-grade eggnog and righteous Christmas wrath, he's made it to his final outpost: a remote satellite workshop originally meant for experimental toy R&amp;D. Here, Nick readies his defenses, makes peace with his maker and prepares to make his last stand in. That’s where you come in…",

One moment I’m bashing baddies with my sword, while the next I’m solving a crime mystery. No one puzzle type or environment overstays its welcome.” The Indie Informer ",

HAUNTED: Halloween '86 (The Curse Of Possum Hollow) is a brand new NES homebrew game featuring side-scrolling, platforming, beat 'em up action! It is the sequel to HAUNTED: Halloween '85 and was originally released on cartridge in October of 2016 for the original Nintendo Entertainment System so it follows all the rules and restrictions of the original hardware. We are releasing a copy of the game in all its pixelated, 8-bit, retro glory for your PC. The cartridge version can be purchased online for those who still have a working NES or clone console!! '86 has been upgraded in every way! You can utilize Tag Team Technology to swap between the two playable characters on the fly throughout the game to take advantage of their separate skills and health meters. The combat system has been completely overhauled from the original and now includes many powerful, new attack moves, defensive moves and evasive moves. We also learned how to do things like split-screen scrolling for parallaxing, animated backgrounds and interactive background objects. There are many new haunts to battle along the way. You can decapitate zombies and then use their removed heads as weapons, combo moves together to smash through the heinous hordes that are taking over the town and find hidden power ups to enhance combat moves and even smash those annoying pumpkins.",

There is only one way to the castle. An abandoned trail through a swamp. You have to get rid of the witch's servants and fix the boat. With the help of the boat, you will move to the castle. You will get through a secret passage to the prince. You will learn the story that the castle is heated by an underwater lake. The water in it is warmed by a dragon, which comes to the underground once a year. There is a flower there that blooms once a year. It is the Queen of the Night. If you find such a flower, the dragon will come again and help defeat the witch's army. But the way to the dungeon is very dangerous. No one has ever been there before. You will find the way to the dungeon and go down there. In the abandoned caves you will find a way out to the other side of the mountain. There you will find an old sea bay, from which the water left long ago. However, there is a pillar of water that has incredibly remained in place. By solving the riddle, you will be able to enter the underwater kingdom. You will dive into the underwater worlds and explore the old bathyscaphe. You will find a lot of artifacts and discover the passageway to the magic flask, where the witch has enchanted the fairy. You can set the fairy free, and she will open a portal to the Dragon's Dwelling. The dragon's dwelling is a nest that floats in the air. A long chain leads to it. You will have to overcome your fear and go up to the nest. First you will explore the secret cave. In this nest you will find the blossoming flower of the Queen of the Night. When you return with it to the castle, you will summon the dragon.",

        "reviews": "“The atmosphere created in tandem between the visual style and the music makes Apotheon one of the most captivating and stylish games in recent memory.” 9.5 – Destructiod “During your journey, you get a pretty good notion of what's at stake through the minimalist artwork and the ominous sounds accompanying you, and you feel immersed in the two-dimensional world, eager to take on the gods and fight for mankind.” 8.5 – Softpedia “Not only is Apotheon a tireless devotion to ancient Greek art and culture, it’s also a damn fun game and one of my surprise early favorites of 2015.” 9 – Game Informer ",

'Pago's Forest: The Dragon's Revenge' is the first part of this trilogy. It focuses mainly on the present tense. This first part emphasizes : - the simple present tense (including that of the auxiliaries 'to be' and 'to have') - the present progressive - the present perfect simple - the present perfect in -ing - the agreement between the conjugated verb and its subject - how to easily find a conjugated verb in a sentence and its infinitive - how to easily find the right subject - identify the people in the conjugation - recognize different pronouns. In case of an error, a help box will appear. After three errors, the story can no longer progress, the player must redo the level and improve his spelling if he wants to know the rest. At the end of each level, the concepts mentioned are shown or reviewed. A lexicon can be consulted at any time in order to facilitate the understanding of the text. A trilogy is in preparation.

Visit the Hatchery to choose your Buddy, and bring it to one of the Isle's lovely beaches to fill its belly with delicious fruit! The more fruit your Buddy eats, the more points you will earn. But remember: Buddies only have a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits. Eating a sour fruit will cause your Buddy to lose time. Also, some fruits are too big to be eaten and will stun your Buddy if they land on its head. Be sure to dodge these obstacles! Use your points to unlock and purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings and colorful wristbands. What are you waiting for? Come play! Gameplay: Fruit will fall from the trees overhead and it is your job to help the buddies catch them. You will control your favorite Lil' Buddy and run back and forth in an arcade style fashion trying to catch as much fruit as you can. You need to catch as much fruit as you can while avoiding dangerous obstacles like coconuts which will hurt your Lil' friends. The more fruit you catch, the more points you earn; which you can use to purchase cool things from the shop or unlock new levels on the island.",
        "about_the_game": "Journey to the remote Isle of Polu, where you will meet the curious and adorable little creatures known as Buddies! Visit the Hatchery to choose your Buddy, and bring it to one of the Isle's lovely beaches to fill its belly with delicious fruit! The more fruit your Buddy eats, the more points you will earn. But remember: Buddies only have a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits. Eating a sour fruit will cause your Buddy to lose time. Also, some fruits are too big to be eaten and will stun your Buddy if they land on its head. Be sure to dodge these obstacles! Use your points to unlock and purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings and colorful wristbands. What are you waiting for? Come play! Gameplay: Fruit will fall from the trees overhead and it is your job to help the buddies catch them. You will control your favorite Lil' Buddy and run back and forth in an arcade style fashion trying to catch as much fruit as you can. You need to catch as much fruit as you can while avoiding dangerous obstacles like coconuts which will hurt your Lil' friends. The more fruit you catch, the more points you earn; which you can use to purchase cool things from the shop or unlock new levels on the island.",

Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

Time is off tempo and you control the 3 Archons tasked with restoring time to its natural rhythm by refueling the Erstwhile Tower. Use their respective powers to protect the Chronoxin fuel from hazards, traps and enemies found in the grid-based isometric levels. Climb the 13 levels by solving hardcore puzzles while thinking fast. Make sure the payload reaches the end of its track, and be ready to protect it with your life. Literally. Use the mage’s Teleportation and Stasis, the scout’s enhanced speed and defusing skill, as well as the soldier’s sword and shield to make sure nothing gets in your way. Encounter a variety of deadly automates and complex traps that will put your brain to the test. But more importantly : don’t lose track of Time, or else, the tower will move without you!",

For example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto etc. This game is based on the background of various celestial bodies in the real solar system. It simulates that astronauts fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. After reach to the Moon select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the whole solar system exploration tour. Due to the long distance of the spacecraft to the target planet, the fuel carried by the spacecraft cannot reach directly. Scientists first created a route to the target planet and set up a number of space refueling stations along the route. During the voyage to the target planet, the spacecraft can dock at the space refueling station to replenish fuel so as to continue the voyage and complete the exploration journey. If the spacecraft runs out of fuel or is hit by a meteorite during exploration, The spacecraft will crash, and the entire mission has failed. Tip: this game needs a certain amount of astronomical knowledge to better complete the task of exploring the entire solar system.",
        "about_the_game": "According to the current astronomical observation and exploration, the solar system is composed of the sun, 9 planets and their satellites. For example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto etc. This game is based on the background of various celestial bodies in the real solar system. It simulates that astronauts fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. After reach to the Moon select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the whole solar system exploration tour.

You can create your own unique unicorn and run around the island playing mini games, using magic, talking to the residents of Unicorn Island, and make your own story! Game Features Unique unicorn creation. Choose the colors of your unicorn to suit your personality. Complete, open world to explore.

No in-game currency to buy. The game is one price. Period. A Note from the Devs Unicorn Tails is the first game from developers RavenFist Studios. We are building this game because our children wanted a video game where they can run around as a unicorn. Unable to find one, we decided to create it. If our kids want to run around as a unicorn, chances are other kids want to run around as a unicorn too. This isn’t Insert-Word-Here Simulator. This is a world that is being crafted with thought and care. We are continuing to develop quests, events, and activities that will keep the game fresh. The more popular the game becomes, the more content we will create. This includes adding new game modes and ways to get off Unicorn Island to see new and distant lands. We are always interested in feedback. What gameplay elements are your children enjoying? What would they like to see added to the game? We’ve already made several additions to gameplay as a result of 5-year-old feedback and will continue to shape the game to be a joy for everyone who plays!",

He never knows if he may break down so he collects them. Our Hero: DR-32 is a little short for his taste but makes up for it in spunk. He has one goal to find the princess. He won't let anything stand in his way. His abilities include super sprinting, super sword slash and he jumps pretty well for a robot. The jumping and sword slash come naturally however with sprinting you will run out of stamina. When your stamina runs out you'll need to wait as it recharges. Our Princess: Amelia is a confident young princess. She was kidnapped by some rogue sentry robots. She waits anxiously for her captain of the guard DR-32 to save her. Our Enemies: Rogue Robots originally of the royal guard. These robots have taken the princess and now want to get rid of their old captain of the guard DR-32.

No one really knows what happens to the old and retired soldiers. They listen of course, to the very far fetched stories that are passed down from mouth to mouth. Where? In the very taverns that are bustling with legends and the young at heart. After years of roaming free, slaying evil and merrymaking in halls of drink, everyone takes an arrow to the knee. They have obligations and duties but most of all, the retired life is boring and redundant. They miss the dangers and wish they were young again. What better way to relive the life than to run a tavern? Travellers and adventurers from all kingdoms, far and wide come aspiring for fame and glory. They tell tales of their adventures, transforming cotton tails to horrendous beasts, morphing storms to witchery! All the danger relived in safety because at the end of the day, the warmth still burns in the fireplace. Your job is to run the tavern - Dragon's Hangover. Some will seek drinks and food while some might seek the warmth of a bed. Manage your tavern and be the host that all adventurers admire. Your journey, as the tavern's keep, begins now.",

        "detailed_description": "Living Roadmap &amp; Discord About the Game Drive 4 Survival is a struggle for survival mostly in the frozen wilderness, where you have to rely only on yourself and your car. The goal of Early Access is simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible. We want to hear your feedback constructively and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process. Your car is an integral part of surviving in the frozen wilderness. But he requires repairs and, most importantly, enough fuel. You will have to look for the last remnants of fuel in the whole world, and sometimes it will be a fight for life. But the reward will be the opportunity to enjoy the fantastic ride and get to distant locations quickly. Always a safe place to rest, and you can also store your vehicles here. The garage can be expanded to make more space available for your vehicles, and most importantly, you will also get your small car workshop for the production of new vehicles. It is necessary to obtain spare parts for the construction of vehicles. The possibility of dismantling or selling captured vehicles at the junkyard will help you with this. For better enjoyment of long journeys in the car around the frozen world, you have available a car radio with a connection to a real online music radio station. Your travels will lead mainly to locations that have succumbed to climate change and are ruled by severe winters, bad weather, and enemies who want only one thing. And that is: make your life as uncomfortable as possible. A helicopter will help you travel between the zones. You begin the game in a relatively safe zone 'The Home - Outpost 103', which will serve as your base. And from this base, you will be able to travel for knowledge and adventure or build your home here according to your ideas. This zone is one of the last not to be affected by the winter apocalypse. But there are still other locations in the world that have not succumb to climate change but are devastated and full of danger. Like an old national park with a motel. Where the game will take you for the first time during the tutorial and where you will find the necessary spare parts to repair your car. You can return to this zone at any time and perform tasks or obtain raw materials. But beware the nights are cold and dangerous here! As soon as you put your first car into operation, you will have the opportunity to travel to the main world 'The Old World'. This is a truly inhospitable world where no rules apply. In the middle of an inhospitable world, you will be mostly alone for everything - you must not trust anyone and not forget that the world around you is your greatest enemy. With minimal initial equipment, you must first solve your basic needs and a safe haven from inclement weather and an inhospitable world. Your car will help you travel faster and a little safer and explore the world. Provide him with enough fuel and embark on a dangerous journey. Currently only part of this world is available (approx. 36km2 of 144 km2). There are many mysterious nooks and places in the world to explore from the last remnants of a civilization that have not yet been covered in snow to mysterious locations. Just like in the home zone, there is an old watchtower, which will need to be found, repaired, and then will serve as a safe haven for you. Where you will be able to plan new trips or recover here after a fight or hide from bad weather. During your travels, whether you are looking for raw materials or exploring the world. You will encounter many enemies. They have their own problems and how many times will they fight among themselves or against their main enemies. Tired of waiting at the base. So build your own house according to your ideas and fantasies. And start a new home here or just a cottage in which you will warm yourself during a long journey. You can build crop fields near your house. And in peace to grow basic crops or just settle down and try to live as a farmer. Do you just want to build and not deal with survival elements? In this case, a new Creative game mode is available to you.

You have been chained to a stranger, a boy foolish—or brave—enough to flee the gilded cage where magi are kept docile and pliant. The curse will kill you both unless you find a way to break it. Anyone else would already be dead, but not you—for you hear the ancient voice of the Abyss, and have been blessed—or cursed—with powers dark and terrible. Did the Abyss bestow upon you supernatural strength and agility? Do you have the power to manipulate the shadows and see what they see? Perhaps your dark gift is prying open the minds of others only to break them and have them do your bidding. Embrace your emotions. The four humors color the tone of your responses and your personality: will you be the carefree sanguine , the thoughtful phlegmatic , the anxious melancholic or the fiery choleric ? Will you stay friends or seek something more? Learn more about your companions, see how they react to the curse placed upon you, accept or reject their aid. Shadow Bonds will give you a glimpse into the friendship and romance system of Sigh of the Abyss . An introduction to the characters and setting of Sigh of the Abyss Customize the protagonist's name and skills A branching narrative with hard choices and terrible consequences Three unique endings with several variations each Sample what the romance interests have to offer, or stay friends Learn more about the rich setting of Sigh of the Abyss through codex entries ",

Explore the world around you to help you learn and understand the rules, and take notes that will help you later in more complicated areas. But there's a catch! After 86 seconds, you will die and the world will be reset to its original form. All that remains constant are your memories. Manage your time wisely and write down your discoveries using a handy-dandy in-game notebook or, better yet, real-life paper! #YOLOAO (You Only Live Over And Over) You are Sluggle: the little green gastropod who has woken up in a world of doom. Sluggle will have to slither through the unknown and experiment with whatever can be found in order to progress and prevail. But it won't be easy! Work your way through a series of rooms and aim to learn something new every 86 seconds, be it a new area, gameplay mechanic, or something else! The fast-paced puzzle game your brain never asked for! Contains three different types of puzzles, and countless ways in which they work: Explore to find various puzzles, some more complex than others Start by solving simple puzzles to learn new rules Combine your gained knowledge to solve the more difficult puzzles, unlocking new areas that will teach you more rules Despite the time limit feature, you are rewarded for exploring. If you try to rush through the game, you'll be facing a series of frustrating trial-and-error puzzles. If you use each 86 seconds wisely and navigate your way around the whole map before attempting your winning run, you will be introduced to a series of weird and wonderful brainteasers that challenge you to think both logically and creatively. But that's not all... While the main objective of 86 will give you a run for your money, your adventure doesn't stop there. There's plenty more to do in the world, and you'll want to play multiple times to find everything! As you familiarise yourself with the game's mysterious rule system, it'll be easier for you to cover more ground quickly within the time limit, and if you're lucky you'll even- -wait, never mind, I'm not supposed to tell you about that part. Awkward. ",

The original intention of conceiving this game is due to the curiosity of what the human society will become in the future. Therefore, by using the existing real-world data and the latest research and exploration results, and referring to the historical data provided by the World Bank. I want to build a simplified and relatively sensible data model that outlines all possible options for future development.

        "about_the_game": "This is a game that simulates how the future of human society will develop and how the solar system should be developed. The original intention of conceiving this game is due to the curiosity of what the human society will become in the future. Therefore, by using the existing real-world data and the latest research and exploration results, and referring to the historical data provided by the World Bank. I want to build a simplified and relatively sensible data model that outlines all possible options for future development.

        "detailed_description": "From the same studio / / About the Game Pro Cycling Manager 2022 makes you a sport director. Make all the decisions necessary to take your team to the top: your responsibilities include recruitment, planning objectives and race programmes, sponsor management, scouting future talent, training, race strategy and much more. You can also create your own rider in Pro Cyclist mode. Join a team and prove you can be the leader, then do what it takes to shine in the peloton. Can you rise to become one of the best? Pro Cycling Manager 2022 lets you compete against players from around the world in online mode . WHAT'S NEW : New talent scouting system A more energetic and attacking peloton More options for customising your game experience An easier-to-use interface (new Cyclist page) Redesigned stamina and resistance system The 21 official stages of the 2022 Tour de France NEW SCOUTING SYSTEM A good sport director must know how to recruit future talent, which is why we have set up a new scouting system. You have to send your scouts to different regions in order to uncover the best talent. Your scouts become more effective and improve over time. They regularly send you information (about potential, characteristics, etc.) which you use to make your choices (observation, integration in the development team, etc.) so you can learn more about the riders. You are, of course, in direct competition with the other teams. NEW GENERATION OF RIDERS This new system is based on the level and potential of the young cyclists, using a 6-star grading system. Now the young riders who are created are juniors from 16 to 18 years old, with the pool comprised of 1,500 to 2,000 young cyclists each year (3 times more than before). These new riders will be more versatile and will develop similarly to the current stars. RIDER DEVELOPMENT Just like with the young talent, we want to have more versatile riders, so the development system has been redesigned to take this into account. It is also critical for your riders to perfectly integrate the team, establishing a good relationship with the coach, or they will not progress optimally. MORE VARIED RACE In Pro Cycling Manager 2022, thanks to a more varied peloton, you experience scenarios that are different from the usual blueprint of a Tour stage, for example. You can find yourself in a race that is action-packed from the start, with favourites taking the lead, and a variety of attacks right from the first hour. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS The interface has been redesigned, with a total overhaul of the cyclist page that now incorporates new statistics, highlighted rider capabilities and results, and the addition of an interface comparing cyclist characteristics. Stamina and resistance scores have a bigger effect on how effort is exerted during a race. This allows some riders to attack several times or manage their effort at the end of the race better. The race-day condition is now closer to the announced provisional condition. To enable comprehensive customisation, you can now adjust 2 parameters: bonus amplitude (from +5 to -5 or complete deactivation) and activation or deactivation of variation. The simulation time has been optimised and is now twice as fast as before. You can now have specific team jerseys for a given race.",

Pro Cycling Manager 2022 lets you compete against players from around the world in online mode . WHAT'S NEW : New talent scouting system A more energetic and attacking peloton More options for customising your game experience An easier-to-use interface (new Cyclist page) Redesigned stamina and resistance system The 21 official stages of the 2022 Tour de France NEW SCOUTING SYSTEM A good sport director must know how to recruit future talent, which is why we have set up a new scouting system. You have to send your scouts to different regions in order to uncover the best talent. Your scouts become more effective and improve over time. They regularly send you information (about potential, characteristics, etc.) which you use to make your choices (observation, integration in the development team, etc.) so you can learn more about the riders.
