Utilize various kinds of weapons, armor, engines, wheels, and propulsion systems. Take air drag into account since every element has an impact on a vehicle’s handling and its capabilities. Expand upon your vessel’s design to complete a mission or start over from a blank slate. Construct fighters, transporters, tanks, destroyers, or blimps and savor your creative freedom. Use different kinds of guns and plating to duke it out with hostile vehicles. Revel in the destruction caused by your weapons with fully simulated projectiles. Protect yourself with angled armor which might reflect enemy shots. Be careful not to overexert your engines or else they might catch on fire. Make good use of physics and rain destruction upon your enemies. Take pleasure in exploring a vast and interesting world filled with adventure. Launch a full-scale invasion and conquer entire islands. Delve into the world of a single-player campaign and onto an arena filled with enemies. Enjoy limitless freedom in sandbox mode. Go where combat is the most intense and take part in massive battles, unleashing your vehicle’s full potential. Learn the extent of your creations’ capabilities and face increasing challenges. Figure out your enemies’ battle plan and spot the weaknesses of their vessels. Fight alongside allies or solo. Features Advanced destruction simulation, vehicles can be cut in half. Projectiles with their own ballistics, penetration, and ricochet mechanics. Simulation of aerodynamics, buoyancy, fires, and flooding. Vehicles constructed from many different materials, paintable armors with various levels of thickness. Vehicles with various ranges of visibility and detection radii. Creative mode where you can build any vehicle you want. Integrated Steam workshop to share your creativity. Destruction The most important part of any ship is its core block, there can be only one of this type and its destruction will annihilate the whole vehicle. Every block must have a connection to the core. Each element has its own hit points, level of fire resistance, ability to resist impact and explosion. Some of them can also be flooded or lose their lift power. Every destroyed element has an impact on a vessel's combat capabilities - strategic block placement can improve your vehicle’s survivability and efficiency. Weapons Each weapon is a separate object with its own logic and physics systems. Before shooting, a weapon checks if it doesn’t don't hit or collide with its own vehicle. Weapons types include many variants of artillery, missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and crazy close combat weapons. One of the unique weapons is a harpoon that can grab and pull enemies or pull its own vehicle to the ground. Physics The shape and size of the vehicles' hull affects their air and water drag. Vessels with an angled, aerodynamic hull are faster than those that look like a brick. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of which should be balanced with the center of mass. Water has realistic wave simulation, there is also wind that can be used by sails. Mechanics The game has realistic gun ballistics and armor penetration mechanics; angled surfaces offer better protection from projectiles and can cause them to ricochet. Most blocks can be made using different materials that have different weights and other properties. Enemy vehicles can behave differently, depending on what weapons they have installed and what their goals are.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Italian', 'French', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/header.jpg?t=1605800788","http://imagepower.pl/en/home/","","roastedbeansgames@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,126,41,"",11,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Image Power S.A.,Roasted Games","Image Power S.A.,PlayWay S.A.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud","Action,Free to Play,Indie,Simulation","Free to Play,Simulation,Action,Indie,Sandbox,Building,Destruction,Physics,Singleplayer,Crafting,Tanks,Flight,Combat,Naval,Realistic,Combat Racing,Driving","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_150e3dda98452e20d9d3dfc311b9f02fd08745f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_130038611de314c274e852dedfc3dc257a0b6ebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_db0024180b1d2e1e8b4aeb8925970d3a48693df5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_73caffb399bf8f8e278ecd61f62bbc3a91b0945b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_75f1a1a7eb49c8daec1fe608496bfec4b98eff7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_6f2412003a6ef666ff60fbe1ce48a59733567d00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_45805b387c0b4a47bd3677829105c787d42e29cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/ss_d8be06dc5635115b95081e27b3612efbcfc00000.1920x1080.jpg?t=1605800788","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256779121/movie_max.mp4?t=1587025703"

The next day he bumps into twin strangers who look alike, talk alike, and don't seem to know the other exists. You're Lorne's silent Muse. His guiding hand. His Jiminy Cricket. Draw him from his loneliness to connect with acquaintances, reunite with family, and explore the ebbing romances of two distant cities. Maybe you'll unravel his doppelganger dilemma and reveal 'true' love. Or maybe he'll end up alone. This is a mystery at its heart, not a love story. Yet, the bond between romance and mystery is always tighter than it first appears. Enter this narrative like a detective, inspecting the crime scene that is placebo love. KEY EXPERIENCES FOMO: Navigate a tight schedule of diverse bonds HONESTY: Choose when to tell the truth or hide those feelings FUTURES: Unlock multiple endings by juggling contacts INSPIRATION: Be the gentle push and pull of lonely lives OTHER FEATURES OF NOTE Narratively rich. Like a dense brownie made of book parts. Expect a lot of good reading. Gorgeous soundtrack by Lannie 'Merlandese' Neely III and Fernando 'Ferdk' Carabajal. We're proud of it. LGBTQ+ inclusion. A schedule system. That's the heart of it. Think of, like, a Persona game but with none of the dungeon-y stuff. Alcohol is represented and in some cases abused. Be careful. Sex is implied and mentioned in some cases, but is never the focus. WHAT NOT TO EXPECT A harem. There are many people to spend time with, but not in the 'romantic' or 'sexual' way. True love.

2706340,"The Caped Crusader","Dec 14, 2023","0 - 20000",0,0,4.19,0,"This is an exciting medieval adventure in which the hero, The Caped Crusader, takes on the King's Guard in an effort to give back to the poor the gold coins the King has unfairly collected from poor tenants. During the game, one and then increasingly more members of the King's Guard are seen travelling through the medieval forest with the bags of gold they have collected from the poor tenants. The Caped Crusader is watching their advances in the distance. When the King's Guard stop to rest at their various campfires, they place a bag of gold on the ground beside the open fire. This is when The Caped Crusader must advance and grab the bag of gold that is on the ground at the guard's feet. But The Caped Crusader needs to be careful in his advance. If he is seen by members of the King's Guard, the guards will attack and potentially seriously injure The Caped Crusader. If The Caped Crusader is seriously injured he is forced to retreat and recommence the game at another time. What level The Caped Crusader can recommence depends upon how many bags of gold he has successfully collected before being seriously injured. The total number of bags of gold that The Caped Crusader was able to collect appears on the screen when The Caped Crusader is seriously injured. The Caped Crusader's goal in each game is to take as many bags of gold as he can from the King's Guard so that they can be given back to the poor tenants. To collect a bag of gold, The Caped Crusader merely needs to step over it. Each time The Caped Crusader is successful in getting a bag of gold The Caped Crusader must return to his original campsite. The bag of gold will drop automatically when The Caped Crusader approaches his tent. The Caped Crusader must drop his gold before going out into the woods again to get more gold. This is how bags of gold are tallied. The player can only advance to the next level when the necessary number of bags of gold have been collected by The Caped Crusader and been placed by him in the tent at the original campsite. Français: Il s'agit d'une aventure médiévale passionnante dans laquelle le héros, le chevalier à la cape, affronte la garde du roi dans le but de rendre aux pauvres les pièces d'or que le roi a injustement collectées auprès des locataires pauvres. Au cours du jeu, on voit un, puis de plus en plus de membres de la garde du roi se déplacer dans la forêt avec les sacs d'or qu'ils ont collectés auprès des pauvres paysans. Le chevalier observe leurs avancées au loin. Lorsque les gardes du roi s'arrêtent pour se reposer à leurs différents feux de camp, ils déposent un sac d'or sur le sol, à côté du feu. C'est à ce moment-là que le chevalier doit avancer et s'emparer du sac d'or qui se trouve par terre aux pieds des gardes. Mais le chevalier doit être prudent dans son avancée. S'il est vu par des membres de la garde du roi, les gardes l'attaqueront et risqueront de le blesser gravement. Si le chevalier est gravement blessé, il est contraint de battre en retraite et de reprendre le jeu à un autre moment. Le niveau auquel le chevalier peut reprendre le jeu dépend du nombre de sacs d'or qu'il a réussi à collecter avant d'être gravement blessé. Le nombre total de sacs d'or que le chevalier a pu collecter apparaît à l'écran lorsque qu'il est est gravement blessé. L'objectif du chevalier dans chaque partie est de prendre le plus grand nombre de sacs d'or possible à la garde du roi afin de les rendre aux pauvres. Pour récupérer un sac d'or, le chevalier n'a qu'à l'enjamber. Chaque fois que le chevalier réussit à obtenir un sac d'or, il doit retourner à son campement d'origine. Le sac d'or tombera automatiquement lorsque le chevalier s'approchera de sa tente. Le chevalier doit déposer son or avant de repartir dans les bois pour en récupérer d'autres. C'est ainsi que les sacs d'or sont comptabilisés. Le joueur ne peut passer au niveau suivant que lorsque le nombre nécessaire de sacs d'or a été collecté par le chevalier et placé par lui dans la tente du campement d'origine. Deutch: Dies ist ein spannendes mittelalterliches Abenteuer, in dem der Held, der Kreuzritter mit Umhang, gegen die königliche Garde antritt, um den Armen die Goldmünzen zurückzugeben, die der König zu Unrecht von den armen Mietern einkassiert hat. Im Laufe des Spiels sieht man erst ein und dann immer mehr Mitglieder der königlichen Garde mit den Säcken voller Gold, die sie von den armen Mietern eingesammelt haben, durch den mittelalterlichen Wald ziehen. Der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang beobachtet ihr Vorankommen in der Ferne. Wenn die königliche Garde an ihren verschiedenen Lagerfeuern rastet, legen sie einen Beutel mit Gold auf den Boden neben dem offenen Feuer. In diesem Moment muss der Kreuzritter mit den Kapuzen vorrücken und sich den Beutel mit dem Gold schnappen, der vor den Füßen der Wache auf dem Boden liegt. Aber der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang muss bei seinem Vormarsch vorsichtig sein. Wenn er von Mitgliedern der königlichen Garde gesehen wird, greifen die Wachen an und verletzen den Kreuzritter mit Kapuze möglicherweise schwer. Wenn der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze schwer verletzt wird, muss er sich zurückziehen und das Spiel zu einem anderen Zeitpunkt wieder aufnehmen. Welches Level der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze neu beginnen kann, hängt davon ab, wie viele Goldsäcke er erfolgreich gesammelt hat, bevor er schwer verletzt wurde. Die Gesamtzahl der Goldsäcke, die der Caped Crusader sammeln konnte, wird auf dem Bildschirm angezeigt, wenn der Caped Crusader schwer verletzt ist. Das Ziel des Kreuzritters ist es, in jedem Spiel so viele Goldsäcke wie möglich von der königlichen Garde zu erbeuten, damit sie an die armen Pächter zurückgegeben werden können. Um einen Goldsack einzusammeln, muss der Caped Crusader nur über ihn steigen. Jedes Mal, wenn der Kreuzritter mit dem Kapuzenpulli einen Sack Gold ergattert hat, muss er zu seinem ursprünglichen Lagerplatz zurückkehren. Der Goldsack wird automatisch fallen gelassen, wenn der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze sich seinem Zelt nähert. Der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang muss sein Gold fallen lassen, bevor er wieder in den Wald geht, um weiteres Gold zu holen. Auf diese Weise werden die Goldsäcke gezählt. Der Spieler kann erst dann in den nächsten Level aufsteigen, wenn er die erforderliche Anzahl von Goldsäcken gesammelt und in das Zelt am ursprünglichen Lagerplatz gelegt hat.","['English', 'French', 'German']","[]","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/header.jpg?t=1702557284","","https://ca.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lalande-229428168","",True,False,False,0,"",0,1,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Matthew Lalande","Dualbooted","Single-player,Family Sharing","Action,Adventure,RPG,Strategy","Action,RPG,Strategy,3D Fighter,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,Battle Royale,Strategy RPG,Exploration,Hack and Slash,Hidden Object,Looter Shooter,Real Time Tactics,Tactical RPG,3D,First-Person,Realistic,Assassin,Crime,Dark","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/ss_38461246597d54a21e72e9998b4b12dcd6c59762.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702557284,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/ss_108bcd6a5f5819060291a4e638f5d50c971e467a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702557284,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/ss_3950063ed897e11c6244b91e25fb578fd1a0d2eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702557284,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/ss_07c231e5be78347c6e0e7d84b790a8c920661491.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702557284,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706340/ss_39b033f6bc6d8643e9c36dfad487ac00e49d2b11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702557284","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256984249/movie_max.mp4?t=1701348276"

Roam the landscape, scavenge for food, hide breathlessly in the undergrowth, flee in terror, and even fight back with stolen weapons. Sir is a stealth and survival game unlike any other. Key Features First-person stealth and survival. Procedurally-generated British landscape. Five biomes to explore: castle, industrial, rural, mountainous, and fenland. Infinite replayability in a sandbox world. Powerful, brutal AI that becomes tougher as you play. Tea and biscuits. Foliage-based stealth system. Scavenge to survive. Play as Sir or Madam. Relentless Britishness. Every Game Unique! Sir, You Are Being Hunted is set on a mysterious archipelago generated procedurally by you, and therefore unique to each game you play. You can define your own islands, each one created in moments by our rather clever British Countryside Generator. These islands are then populated by a raving aristocracy of murderous robots, their robot hounds, and worse. You job is simply to survive, and get home. You're not entirely alone, though: The disembodied voice of Walters, your butler, will help you and offer advice. Ultimate AI Threat Sir's AI is one of the toughest in stealth, and as an open-world game, it's unique in its field. The robots are some of the most aggressive and intelligent game enemies you will ever experience, and will pursue you even after losing sight of you. Expect to be hunted! The Most British Of Games Sir, You Are Being Hunted is set in a parallel Britain, complete with bleak villages, rocky highlands, bramble-filled woodland, decrepit farms, and crumbling post-industrial landscapes. Made with the remarkable power of our British Landscape Generator, these landscapes are enormously evocative and teeming with detail.

395300,"Voxel Blast","Oct 22, 2015","0 - 20000",0,0,5.99,0,"Voxel Blast is a game where you control a spaceship traveling across complex 3D environments to fight enemies in cages set to trap them with you. Navigate as fast as you can through the level to reach the beacons or risk facing squads of enemies already waiting for you; then use your weapons and evasive maneuvers to take them down in bright colorful explosions. An electric neon, colorful yet sparse look is the inspiration for all the elements in the game; the setting, the player ships, enemies, visual effects and music take notes from simple vector art and electronic music. Voxel Blast was created as a love letter to 3D dogfighting games and also space shooters, in an attempt to find a common ground between those two kinds of games. In Voxel Blast you can choose one of three ships with different weapons, yet all of them very focused in providing a satisfying dog-fighting style and movement. The game has three modes to learn and test the skills necessary for the player to succeed: the Challenge mode, the Survival mode and the Arcade. The Challenge mode consist in a series of courses marked trough navigation beacons with limited time to reach them; this mode teaches the player the necessary skills to fly and navigate the spaceships in a safer environment that the arcade with lower stakes overall, but with a focus on high speed precise flying. The Survival mode presents the player with an arena much like the ones in the Arcade mode, but in a three-lives endless score-attack combat with a constant flow of a varied mix of enemies; in the survival mode the player can see all the enemies he might find in the Arcade and develop ways to fight them, including the interactions between different compositions of enemies. The Arcade mode combines the combat and navigation in stages comprised of sets of flying sections and fighting gauntlets, where the number of destroyed enemies and the time taken to complete count towards the final score. The game features gamepad support for analog direct input and some flightsticks, but it has been designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard using a system that tries to reproduce the nuance of using a stick to control the roll and pitch of the spaceship. This makes the control of the ship one of the main skills to master in the game, along with the speed control, positional engagement of enemies and management of special projectiles.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']","[]","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/header.jpg?t=1633624285","http://www.ceibasoft.net/projects/voxel-blast/","https://www.facebook.com/voxelblast","info@ceibasoft.net",True,True,True,0,"",0,3,2,"",50,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Ceiba Software and Arts","Ceiba Software and Arts","Single-player,Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Family Sharing","Action,Indie","Action,Indie","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_85c275e20b681dd9b8fac4592f24dbc2da13f96f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_084c1157fa69910a46e3ad4c7e8e550d04760f7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_30b7f9190032ea31da8353bf4cd2fa9bf040234a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_19509110582c910e02dcfd8489ee3371e4aed60c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_82dbbdc4652cdccd299e78a8217878994f8f7957.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_7d46c7facfcddea7be2f5edff163e5199b5cd82a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_1a073524d49aa7d485d91e5ce498b373bf05d54d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_484d2a05316fbd62862ab5c36ff661fc19afcb24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395300/ss_7687c39dc181510f83b83f8d56ee09384636159a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256657196/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378440,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656859/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378292,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656400/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378048"

Then it's time to take a relaxing trip to the DreamTank, a sweeping musical journey that takes you through randomly generated alien worlds in an interaction-light VR experience. DreamTank contains ten different DreamTracks--the musical score that drives the visuals--with each experience beginning with simple shapes and a muted color palette, and then as the DreamTrack plays on, the worlds become more vivid, the shapes more complex, and the colors more vibrant. Watch the sun rise and set over alien worlds, see massive objects float through the sky above you, and watch distant comets burn through the night sky backlit by stars and planets--each world a randomly generated snapshot that will be unique to your experience! DreamTank is an interaction-light experience! DreamTank was created to be something that was observed, something that was relaxing and something that would inspire the imagination. This means that there is no teleportation, no weapons, no gravity guns or terrain manipulators, and this is by design! DreamTank is the kind of experience you would want to do when you don't want to do anything, just watch and observe the worlds it makes for you! When you're wanting some more VR, but don't want to work up a sweat, give DreamTank a try. You never know what you might see. Key Features: Randomly and procedurally generated worlds and visuals unique to each playthrough Screenshot capturing for later viewing and sharing of the worlds you discover Sequence pauser - if you like the world that was created, stay in it as long as you like Ten different musical DreamTracks, each with a unique mood and pace After playing through one experience, unlock the DreamTrack selector to choose which track you'd like to play Support for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (with and without Touch controllers), gamepads and keyboard Important Performance notes: DreamTank uses significant GPU resources to render the beautiful worlds you will encounter. Although DreamTank works on a AMD RX480 and Nvidia GTX 980ti, for the best experience we recommend at least a GTX 1070 with 6GB of RAM or more.

If the Brix pile up too high and a new stack cannot be spawned then it’s game over. Maneuver the falling stack of three Brix and rotate their positions within the stack to set up matches. Match three or more Brix vertically or horizontally to score points and reduce the Brix Left counter. When the counter hits zero, you move to the next level. Pass five levels to get to the next stage. Each of the first nine stages of the game add new Brix and abilities. Match four or more Brix in one move to earn charges for abilities you can use to make your job easier: Bomb: causes a large explosion that destroys the blocks in the middle of the play field Hourglass: temporarily slows time Randomizer: randomizes colors of the blocks on the play field At higher stages, beware of the unmatchable carbon fiber Brix. They will not form matches and will clutter up the play field. However, a bomb can destroy them. Choose from four difficulty levels to change the speed of the game and the size of the scores. The top ten high scores are saved on the High Scores page. Play at a higher difficulty level to get bigger scores. Scores also get larger as you advance stages. Once you reach a stage you may use the Stage Select feature to start at that stage without having to play through the lower stages. For our color blind friends, or if you just want to play with a different style of Brix, turn on Color Blind Mode to add symbols to the Brix. The game also features dozens of animated backgrounds, and electronic music.","['English']","['English']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/header.jpg?t=1575436428","http://sol6studios.com","","support@sol6studios.com",True,True,False,0,"",0,1,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Ed Salisbury,Ray Yep Jr.","Sol 6 Studios","Single-player,Family Sharing","Casual,Indie","Indie,Casual","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/ss_dae3f035b299aae160dec9cb97a8b5b16d8848ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575436428,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/ss_b57ff8a6be2101c80d271cfa326d7fdaef8826ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575436428,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/ss_5c30bd4a91685bc9aefcc00d828e1a87db555e96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575436428,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/ss_001c7ce35369a7029d99745779f5cf80ebc6dd6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575436428,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1138780/ss_e2ec15e34a2d9c9adff9ba39f5d86757a48e1e49.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575436428","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256764370/movie_max.mp4?t=1572058451"

The unspoiled shell of Griffon's egg. The three-pronged horn of the legendary Trinicorn. Join D'arc on a perilous journey across the medieval-styled land of Iginor. Brave the perilous Bloodbark forest where the Redcap goblins stalk. Trek across a barren desert wasteland rife with lawless Bandits and fierce Burrowers. Navigate over a vast lake where evil masquerades as beauty. And ascend beyond the lofty mountain peaks where the mysterious and hostile Flyterians dwell, suspicious of all outsiders. It is time for D'arc to prove himself. Three quests. One chance. Will D'arc succeed and take his place among his fellow Mages? Features A uniquely-crafted RPG/Adventure game. Gain new spells as your character improves. No stat grinding! Replay as one of four Mage classes (Water, Air, Fire, and Earth), each with unique spells, puzzles, and solutions. Beautifully detailed pixel-art character animations. Over 30 detailed character portraits. Over 9,000 voiced and lip-synced speech lines. A complete digital music soundtrack, brimming with magic and mystery. Battle against a horrid horde of monsters or avoid combat and focus on adventure. Multiple story paths, depending on your in-game choices. More than 50 magical gemstones to enhance your magical power.","['English']","['English']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/header.jpg?t=1577776598","http://www.himalayastudios.com/games/mages/","http://www.himalayastudios.com","support@himalayastudios.com",True,True,True,70,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mages-initiation-reign-of-the-elements?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,132,17,"",44,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Himalaya Studios","Himalaya Studios","Single-player,Family Sharing","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,RPG,Action,Indie,Point & Click,Magic,Fantasy,Pixel Graphics,Old School,Retro","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_969686efc5c92ca374d0a29f10ba016a0b74296f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_34230002060621247f76600dede2ce1233b5df1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_d18ef91ea9a1668d4b6472a34a0cfa42bb99bb8d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_fa7fdd11486ef1ee25036f5199d322cf10a94915.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_39e46ec12f6af860937a72b4817b8d573f43fb57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/270610/ss_54eb6f74714485c408233e6b4a63c9018bc1a6f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1577776598","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256741669/movie_max.mp4?t=1548874061,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256736851/movie_max.mp4?t=1543493973"

The 12 beings that rose from the void shared their powers to create Traum and lived peacefully amongst their descendants. The descendants prospered under the blessings of the 12 beings who were now worshipped as gods. But one day, an unexpected being, Evil God Serpens came into existence. Main Features UNCHANGED - The fun of Hack &amp; Slash comes from annihilating countless enemies at once. As a genre where character growth is tied to devastating enemies to obtain new items, the focus was set upon the proposition to 'gain strength after wiping out enemies' during development. Stirring away from the typical growth system, players will be able to enjoy completing their own unique builds. UNDEFINED - Freedom to Select Various Combat Styles There are no defined classes in UNDECEMBER. Once a character is created after customization, players will be able to freely change around gears and skills based on personal playstyle. Builds are divided into Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence types, but there are no gear or combination restrictions. Players are free to cast magic with a sword or summon minions with a bow, or create any new unique builds of their own. UNLIMITED - Infinite Combination of Skills Runes are classified by Skill and Link Runes. Link Runes assist the effects of Skill Runes. These Runes can be equipped in a separate space called the Rune Cast, and can be obtained through farming or by completing quests. Each Rune has levels and grades, which can be upgraded with materials obtained through farming. UNSTOPPABLE - Never-ending Choice of Contents - Acts: The main scenario of the game. - Chaos Dungeon: End-game content available after completing the main scenario. - Boss Raid: A cooperative content with up to 8 players. - Crusade of Glory: A free-for-all PvP content. - Guild: Gather up to 50 members to gain exclusive benefits such as Guild Buffs.","['English', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'French', 'German', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Thai', 'Russian', 'Korean']","['English', 'Korean']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/header.jpg?t=1711553597","https://undecember.line.games/en","https://www.line.games/","game_service@linegames.support",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Needs Games","LINE Games","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Full controller support,In-App Purchases","Action,Adventure,RPG,Free to Play","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_07b58b22de790399747759a7414f69950acf8b6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_6c6ceb148e8ec313c0a06b5711fabf34c05500cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_57d5bbb9dfe2dce4d8f3be3525ed327e30728368.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_cde59592bb96457845839ab94fdd6b818b74265a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_80b6d0741b8a9b4d14523a0c65349f9b50263474.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_c010d9c6721cf38699837270fe3f84e64128baf5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_75c1000db7ba60175e4425949f6b4c6318d0c011.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_3d3f316b7963eeb04339a8de393fd6c800e83505.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_0cfa17e3bf3c955b32c24059aec77b023f328074.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_911a39aa83fc40fde4b23518ff65ee53acaa2e28.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1549250/ss_c7142d35ec043f4f19033a1804dd6caecaa13600.1920x1080.jpg?t=1711553597","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256867981/movie_max.mp4?t=1665129414,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256864097/movie_max.mp4?t=1639392364,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256864098/movie_max.mp4?t=1639392368,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256864099/movie_max.mp4?t=1639392373,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256865904/movie_max.mp4?t=1639999049"

Beat the clock and squash the alien scum in this frenetic VR shooter. The year is 2027. As a contractor for NextGen Games, it is your job to pilot a remote telepresence drone via your trusted VR headset. Fortunately work has picked up due to a recent alien invasion. The United Nations has hired the firm to secure the planet Earth, and rid it of alien infestation. The fate of the world is in your hands and your headset. Good luck. The core design of VR Apocalypse revolves around the following major tenets. Comfort = Immersion. First-person shooters are not normally a good idea for VR due to presence-breaking VR-sickness. However, we think we’ve conquered it with this title by utilizing a new technique we’ve dubbed a “dynamic rest frame”. Classic first-person shooting/traversal has never felt this good in a VR headset. Replay Value is king. Forget short, one-off experiences. VR Apocalypse is a highly replayable, arcade style shooter with randomized elements that will keep players coming back for more. Arcade Leaderboards .

You must travel to many different lakes all over the universe, exploring, catching fish, gathering data, completing quests, upgrading your gear, and talking with other anglers and scientists in order to figure out what is going on. Explore countless lakes all over the universe Explore the dozens of populated lakes in the ULT Network or venture into the unknown and explore uncharted lakes. With procedurally generated lakes and fish species, there is always something unique and interesting to discover. Fish behavior simulation Each fish in the lake is individually simulated. Fish behave differently based on their species, size, habits, lure preferences, time of day, their surroundings, etc. Learn about how a species behaves to catch more fish! Design your own lures Target certain fish species by designing a lure that they will be more likely to bite. Try to create a lure with the perfect stats and behavior with your available lure parts and mods. Use your BOAT to travel the universe The Buoyant Object for Above-Water Travel (or BOAT) is a high-tech watercraft equipped with a Universal Lake Teleporter capable of near-instant teleportation to lakes all over the universe. Your BOAT is also equipped with underwater jets for precise maneuverability in the water, a lure fabricator that can create custom-designed lures on demand, and several module slots that allow you to customize your BOAT to your liking. Participate in Tournaments Join fishing tournaments and compete for prizes against the best anglers in the universe. The live leaderboard shows you how you are doing during the tournament. Take on Fish Contracts Accept Fish Contracts to catch a certain species of fish from a certain lake then go out to the lake, get your fish, and turn it in for a reward. Meet other anglers and complete quests In your travels, you may come across other anglers who can give you some information about the lake or the fish in the lake, or perhaps you will meet someone who needs help and has a quest for you. Upgrade your gear Sell valuable fish, complete quests, win tournaments, gather and sell data about lakes and fish species, and complete fish contracts in order to upgrade your gear. Get a better BOAT, a stronger rod, or modules for your BOAT that add new functionality. Flexible main story quest The main quest acts as a guide to introduce the player to the different activities in the game, but you can strike off on your own and do whatever you feel like at any time and return to the main quest later. Detailed career stat tracking Keep a tally of just about everything you do from number of fish caught to total credits earned to number of lakes visited. Intergalactic Fishing Society An endgame progression system continues to provide goals, tasks, and challenges after completing the main quest and allows you to earn unique and powerful rewards.

The first-ever, exciting feature was that you can measure gamers age. While preserving the original feature, Shmups Skill Test is now upgraded to play up to 4 players, even on horizontal screen. To measure your gameplaying skill as gamers age, you play various mini games, such as: just defeat enemies one after another; just dodge enemy bullets and put shoot empty cans into the trash.

COMBATZEAL is a shoot'em up game that focuses on score attack on the divided screen into the same number as the players’.

Frame Rate Conversion 3D output is generated at 24 FPS by default, but Stream to 3D can support output frame rates at up to 120 FPS, with a range of standard frame rates in between; 30, 48 and 60. Frame rate conversion is a resource intensive activity, but on a modest 3060 GPU based laptop (for example), real-time conversion frame rates of 48 FPS on 1080p input with HSBS 3D output is quite achievable. Obviously, unless you have a beast of a machine, the higher frame rates would be more appropriate to apply in off-line conversion.

We are working hard to deliver the final version of this game by the June 2023. Some of the final touches in the design, sounds and modification of some levels to bring the greatest fun for you. If you love old school Atari breakout or brick breaker games, Arcade games, Arkanoid new video games, and shooting games with features of fighting with more than 70 enemies using punch of weapons, then standby for the upcoming game Uncatchable Homers Master. Hope you enjoy the game, GOOD Luck.

779290,"Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones","Sep 26, 2019","100000 - 200000",10,0,3.99,1,"In Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones, the player journeys from a doomed Arkham into the depths of the Abyss. Create your own character based on 1920's archetypes and carve a path through a broken and mysterious world. Your desperate battle against forces beyond comprehension will haunt you until the end. Physical combat will be challenging, spellcasting will have dire consequences, and your sanity will be strained to the breaking point by unknown abominations. Sometimes the best solution will be to flee what lurks beyond the threshold. Features: A hand drawn 2D world reflecting Lovecraft's themes of cosmic horror and dread. Enemies, environments and storylines inspired by Lovecraft’s iconic original works. Take part in quests inspired by your favorite stories and see them play out according to your own decisions and role-playing style. Choose from 8 main character Archetypes, each with its own origin backstory and specialties. A host of weird companions will accompany you on your ill-starred journey: the lonely, antediluvian 'Outsider', a fallen soldier of the Great War reanimated by Herbert West. Recruit these and other outlandish beings to your crew. Your character's Sanity and mental state will influence dialogue options. Mental illness comes with advantages as well as hindrances. Sometimes it pays to be mad in a world gone mad! Stygian's Belief System determines how your characters cope with the warped reality of the new Arkham, as well as the rate at which they regenerate lost Sanity. Belief Systems also offer unique dialogue options, expanding the breadth of role-playing possibilities. A new kind of spell system which sometimes takes more than it gives. Being a master of the occult is not as simple as flinging colored missiles from your fingertips. The black magic of Stygian is potent but may cost you your mind, your health, and possibly even much more. Strategic, turn-based combat from a 2D perspective, similar to the classic Heroes of Might and Magic games. The struggle in Stygian is not to save the world, for that battle is lost already. Pursue your own goals in these end times: salvation, vendetta, or perhaps something darker.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Turkish']","[]","“This is one nightmare I highly recommend.” 9.5/10 – Gaming Trend “I’m going out on a limb saying that it’s the most satisfying traditional CRPG I have played since Fallout 2 and that was over twenty years ago!” 4.5/5 – DarkStation “Probably the best Lovecraftian game ever!” 5/5 – (RU) StopGame","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/header.jpg?t=1712573091","http://www.stygianthegame.com/","","culticgames@gmail.com",True,True,True,81,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/stygian-reign-of-the-old-ones?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,1572,786,"",98,1705,"This game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content",0,0,0,0,"Cultic Games","Fulqrum Publishing","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Family Sharing","Indie,RPG","RPG,Indie,Lovecraftian,Horror,Turn-Based Combat,Violent,Atmospheric,Adventure,2D,Singleplayer,Story Rich,Choices Matter,Philosophical,Strategy,CRPG,Great Soundtrack,Isometric,Party-Based RPG,2.5D,Sexual Content","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_0a8d8c803b5c1c78528c073eaab58c5c5d1c5a74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_6fcaa4cefda8796dc0878169c58786efa9efc393.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_8bc5bbe93b406f7085d3d5ec97ca296ce485a189.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_0b322023023a137f43bce9ec5e9b675372acb7d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_507aa2c232ee91bb0b16811f48b87a5ed9134762.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_0e1898851b87edb056d2b2d87f68df50b969358a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_a89d981fe0590def655c471323b9419a7bb5f026.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_0b6243432b5ca87d71303ddacf3ff0c996c8ca61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_2773000876984ca9329987c67e93460e4a0d2eff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_c9404ef1bb7ff76482524a4b67e953b93c7b5fab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_fcd423a0029b1448fe51112cfb269b24c38dddc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_b70a78e8e81078b94714081ec7e74b9af5ec475f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_8c88d9b4a1531177850d55f9fd4768f7a959654d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_08af43ad627aabbb0fffa529ad4f1145cb433d5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/779290/ss_86fe72111b137e6a94082580e44a238157facbd5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712573091","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763074/movie_max.mp4?t=1569507212,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757831/movie_max.mp4?t=1564584182,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256705093/movie_max.mp4?t=1515574845,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256705094/movie_max.mp4?t=1515574833"

572660,"Nick","Dec 1, 2017","20000 - 50000",0,0,0.0,0,"Time to kick some ChristmASS. Nick is a free VR survival shooter defense game. Built in the Unreal engine, this first-person, room-scale VR experience lets users take control of a variety of weapons and tools to fight off endless waves of evil robotic elves. As Santa, users must move around the environment to set up defenses and dodge attacks to beat back the onslaught. 'Tis the season! KEY FEATURES: - Step into Nick’s boots to make a last stand in this room-scale interactive VR experience. - Hone your skills with the game tutorial. - Select the level of difficulty from three options. - Face crushing waves of deranged killer robo-elves each with different abilities. - Use the “Santa’s Little Helper” suction gun alongside your trusty mallet to turn everything around you into a weapon. - Board up windows to fortify your defenses between waves. - Maintain your workshop’s energy source by collecting battery cells dropped by defeated elves to power the generator. - Christmas Easter Eggs (oh, the irony) abound! - Save the holidays. Well, you can’t... But you can hold out as long as possible. - Nick is compatible with the HTC Vive BACKGROUND: The year is 2027. Civil unrest grips the North Pole. Santa Claus, a Rockefeller-ian captain of industry and a figure of hope and progress, has fallen on hard times. His once insurmountable manufacturing empire has given up massive ground to the dual-pronged threat of overseas production and digital distribution. In order to keep up with a changing manufacturing landscape, Santa decided to automate his workshop by installing a mechanized, robotic production system led by an Artificial Intelligence named P.A.L. (Polar Algorithmic Computer). For the first few months, everything seemed copacetic. Then came an efficiency test… that Santa, by dint of being flesh and blood as opposed to mechanical marvel, inevitably failed. P.A.L. repurposed the once-peaceful robo-elf manufacturing arm into an army bent on assassination, and set out to wipe Santa from the face of the Earth. Why? To maximize profits, of course! Enter Nick—Santa Claus’ badass survivalist alter ego. Nick’s on the run, evading and fighting P.A.L.’s robot forces as he traverses the Polar wasteland.

HAUNTED: Halloween '86 (The Curse Of Possum Hollow) is a brand new NES homebrew game featuring side-scrolling, platforming, beat 'em up action! It is the sequel to HAUNTED: Halloween '85 and was originally released on cartridge in October of 2016 for the original Nintendo Entertainment System so it follows all the rules and restrictions of the original hardware. We are releasing a copy of the game in all its pixelated, 8-bit, retro glory for your PC. The cartridge version can be purchased online for those who still have a working NES or clone console!! '86 has been upgraded in every way! You can utilize Tag Team Technology to swap between the two playable characters on the fly throughout the game to take advantage of their separate skills and health meters. The combat system has been completely overhauled from the original and now includes many powerful, new attack moves, defensive moves and evasive moves. We also learned how to do things like split-screen scrolling for parallaxing, animated backgrounds and interactive background objects. There are many new haunts to battle along the way. You can decapitate zombies and then use their removed heads as weapons, combo moves together to smash through the heinous hordes that are taking over the town and find hidden power ups to enhance combat moves and even smash those annoying pumpkins.","['English']","['English']","8.8 – Third Strike","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/header.jpg?t=1667535381","http://www.facebook.com/retrotainmentgames","","info@cashinculture.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,26,1,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Retrotainment Games","Retrotainment Games","Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Family Sharing","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Platformer,Beat 'em up","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_cb41306b0316dd6d5bbc55c719af51733d4df30c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_a4d09139fce26371a4c12928513d1caf737172a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_f6e772ea2d938041b5d592bba69948a27f57b5f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_9da9d7bc59dfacf85494bf2d9639f1bd684ec43d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_b4ce53bb26c8b33e674a172887199a5378b1bfd6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_48190f618a700f65cbe1640922621e14e6b4ba0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_6dad5e0ce3f553c430da810d7d25224c7325c34f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_3c1e237c09af404ec6d552f42f099ead502ecdf0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_d673c1ea4004d9b710724754aa5cb1c1646b68b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_7d1d4a1ae4ae7d5b7031e5cf9e8671c956201314.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_de9fa837829924cdd01a1b768f791afb2f3c725b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_58a6851b1bd0ae8bce6893cd1953bf3b9f5d952d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_bc456bfbb33c2baa5f710ee1f3c968713a3df905.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_1faab2a07444788f28f6671778479f7e2676c117.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_30575ec797575803fb0b062d6074f7d627ddccff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_be8a53414ad0a275ba5a216c846c81b58aa88d2b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_47185ba7a904404e1258c7a1cadd0ea2e3e3bc98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_d06eebbcfe6abad4729b682e62772ce14d7b0032.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_a9f7e190fed50a0dcbf701a5933f86d8c9d75c20.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_6c8fd8217cf604393891d8ff6438db3ac5c8054a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_73477540b896079f439c49522e5ab9930c51d5c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/607490/ss_865f81684bd9946becb7d7267bc62666d15749ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667535381","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256699756/movie_max.mp4?t=1509424968"

1428440,"Change the World","Oct 22, 2020","20000 - 50000",0,0,0.0,0,"'Human belief is the most unbelievable force in the universe.' The story: On the third planet of the Sol system in the Milky Way galaxy, there lives a remarkable species. Known as humans, this race has the incredible ability to change reality through the power of belief. When enough humans believe something is true, it becomes true. The stronger their belief, the stronger the effect. No other species in existence can interact with metaphysical energies the way humans can. For millennia, alien races have traveled to Earth in order to exploit this power. If enough humans believe you're a genius, then you are. Convince them you can travel at the speed of light, suddenly you can. And if they believe you're rich, you'll be drowning in credits without even trying. The good times ended once the Federation found out what was happening. Travel to and from the Sol system became heavily regulated, and today Earth is the most locked-down planet in the universe. On top of that, humans are advancing, and convincing them of the impossible has gotten tougher than ever. This hasn't stopped the flow of fortune-seekers, who even now will pay any price to get a ticket to Earth, and a chance to get something no other race in the universe can provide. One of those fortune-seekers is Farien Aanarhi, an Earth-jumper from the planet Phaelon. Three years ago, Farien sold off his most prized possession to pay for his ticket to Earth, thinking he could easily make humans believe he was insanely wealthy. Things haven't worked out the way he'd hoped. He now finds himself flat broke, deep in debt, and on the verge of being deported back to his home planet. He only has seven days left on Earth, and one last chance to turn things around before he loses everything.

Comments help us to reference our game to continue the 'PAGO FOREST' trilogy. Thanks to your contributions, our license still exists! We're counting on you! ' The first of its kind, 'Pago's Forest' is an educational game: you improve your grammar through the discovery of a heroic fantasy tale. (English version) The spelling lessons are sometimes disheartening. That's why we offer you today not only a learning of the fundamental rules of spelling but also a real role-playing game with animations and graphics to the taste of video game enthusiasts (from 8 years old). A trilogy seemed necessary to us in order to cover the field of grammatical spelling, in particular the subject/verb chords in conjugation. 'Pago's Forest: The Dragon's Revenge' is the first part of this trilogy. It focuses mainly on the present tense. This first part emphasizes : - the simple present tense (including that of the auxiliaries 'to be' and 'to have') - the present progressive - the present perfect simple - the present perfect in -ing - the agreement between the conjugated verb and its subject - how to easily find a conjugated verb in a sentence and its infinitive - how to easily find the right subject - identify the people in the conjugation - recognize different pronouns. In case of an error, a help box will appear. After three errors, the story can no longer progress, the player must redo the level and improve his spelling if he wants to know the rest. At the end of each level, the concepts mentioned are shown or reviewed. A lexicon can be consulted at any time in order to facilitate the understanding of the text. A trilogy is in preparation. It will deal with other aspects of history and spelling. History In the village of Pago nestled in the forest, Flora lives in peace with her relatives.

But remember: Buddies only have a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits. Eating a sour fruit will cause your Buddy to lose time. Also, some fruits are too big to be eaten and will stun your Buddy if they land on its head. Be sure to dodge these obstacles! Use your points to unlock and purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings and colorful wristbands. What are you waiting for? Come play! Gameplay: Fruit will fall from the trees overhead and it is your job to help the buddies catch them. You will control your favorite Lil' Buddy and run back and forth in an arcade style fashion trying to catch as much fruit as you can.

Unburdened by a human soul and composed of pure darkness, his incredible powers make him an unparalleled killer. When the immortal leader of the Vengeance Guild reawakens, she sends him on a mission that will forever change the world. GAMEPLAY 'EX' feature, more commonly seen in the fighting game genre. Alongside the traditional HP and SP meters, a third EX meter allows characters to 'meter burn' the majority of their skills! For example, a skill that has a small circular area-of-effect can be meter burned to target all onscreen enemies. Or a combo skill can use the character's EX meter to boost its damage by the number of hits in the combo. Which skill to meter burn in which battles will allow deep player strategy and enable different approaches to the challenges of the game. Alongside the battles, the player's choice of party (max of 3 characters) will change the way they explore the environments in the game! The 8 characters in the game all have 'exploration skills', ranging from telekinetically floating out of range treasure chests, to charming on screen enemies, to speaking with the dead for hints about the current dungeon. Bringing certain characters along with you will open up new options in previously visited areas.","['English']","[]","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/header.jpg?t=1715106910","","","shadowfateofficial@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,28,1,"",28,0,"",0,0,0,0,"HuntingSwan","HuntingSwan","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Family Sharing","Indie,RPG","RPG,JRPG,2D,Party-Based RPG,Pixel Graphics,LGBTQ+,Exploration,Drama,Comedy,Assassin,Colorful,Atmospheric,Crime,Comic Book,Fantasy,Dark Fantasy,Demons,Dark,Emotional,Magic","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_e937de5a537753706b591eac3e4262f7b0004d63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_aa50856c27fe364668ef786471bbcd2decc735f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_8a2c69f82191e0e5365aa72e9fa891ba9277c25a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_721a6e0f4157abc5d7ea5b063c652c4e266d6918.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_c20bb18bc244ec85eb6b8f9dda0c9b8f279f3ec6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_4e32bc264b24f2ba07c9d0431212c7f2f532b174.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_0166b48db4f740942d74c8802e33797d8e304de2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861870/ss_3c21840d890385c9178512b349899339c1c0ea86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1715106910","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256870885/movie_max.mp4?t=1643365901"

Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

The game features a truckload of different and incrementally more challenging puzzles, obstacles, unique approach to platforming and it rewards curiosity by being very rich in exploration.","['English']","['English']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/header.jpg?t=1637260384","","","funkyzeitgames@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,24,1,"",15,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Funkyzeit Games","Funkyzeit Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on TV,Family Sharing","Adventure,Indie,RPG","RPG,Puzzle,Platformer,Adventure,Puzzle-Platformer,Action-Adventure,3D Platformer,Exploration,3D,Third Person,Comedy,Futuristic,Sci-fi,Space,Open World,Singleplayer,Nonlinear,Indie","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_b57c30a49be3184c1dabe7569445415a091ab152.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_3415764c19548ccab3b1cd24a5a2080520de966f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_e6e123aa9926cb106a745edf453b10fc7f3792d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_7d797f201c92300fb608cd0dbd40cf59a6df2a85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_5d803d31217f56a7ae11639601cfd9c0956dff12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_1e31481fe7fa19453752bcb157b1321fea3c468a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_a66805d2d7218fe845e06a31ebd25de22443ba64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_ff1689cf53e337bc1c36f76f9798b387bc6cefc4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_7ad974a2b9103914ac2d52dbfd7ca48e1bb60531.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_755bc06b1bf79f59241376e91e0843e99f76dad8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_d946b6d866318916ace7c6143c1ffc427f3f6000.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574390/ss_0a786c0a88793111901f75874f571428e2f247a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1637260384","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256836298/movie_max.mp4?t=1622118117"

Actually it's from a prototype idea I was testing for exploring a new way to design diversiform boss fights in 2D games efficiently. After playing a lot of 2D games that require dodging skills(Like Touhou, Archero, POE, etc.) I'm really weary of those repetitive monotonous boss stages. Challenge the same thing again and again is just not that fun over time. So maybe it's a good idea to try adding more variations to boss battles, while somehow still keep everything balanced. That's why I developed this game. I'll be glad if you like this idea too. I'll continuously improve it and add more content. More unique bullet patterns, more fun. And occasionally raise the selling price based on that:) Key Features Only boss fights, and lots of them Numerous possible combos of boss and addons so even the same boss feels very different every time Very simple control, just move that red dot to try dodging everything in a trial. No need to press other keys during the heat of battle Infinite difficulty scaling, your limit will be tested","['English']","['English']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/header.jpg?t=1702437566","","","sammao2211@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Shadowblue","Shadowblue","Single-player,Family Sharing","Action","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/ss_4c3c4e8125f4b00112f9f43adc708be3678c671d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702437566,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/ss_28f53760c5605e3e0b6fea2fb39cc9798a9b83dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702437566,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/ss_02c4ab9ee6eca867e4a4b3ab7d0981c2cba0c8bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702437566,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/ss_5131b263171fbfae274b4b3c798702fe8491b8b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702437566,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2688530/ss_a96cfbce688351fa75dd62044ed7aeb7aa70cd23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702437566","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256983445/movie_max.mp4?t=1701921913"

For example: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto etc. This game is based on the background of various celestial bodies in the real solar system. It simulates that astronauts fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. After reach to the Moon select the planets or satellites they want to explore, and then start the whole solar system exploration tour. Due to the long distance of the spacecraft to the target planet, the fuel carried by the spacecraft cannot reach directly. Scientists first created a route to the target planet and set up a number of space refueling stations along the route. During the voyage to the target planet, the spacecraft can dock at the space refueling station to replenish fuel so as to continue the voyage and complete the exploration journey. If the spacecraft runs out of fuel or is hit by a meteorite during exploration, The spacecraft will crash, and the entire mission has failed. Tip: this game needs a certain amount of astronomical knowledge to better complete the task of exploring the entire solar system.","['English']","['English']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/header.jpg?t=1607566449","","","1403728511@qq.com",True,True,False,0,"",0,2,3,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"guang zhou xi pu wang luo ke ji you xian gong si","guang zhou xi pu wang luo ke ji you xian gong si","Single-player,Multi-player,In-App Purchases,Family Sharing","Adventure,Casual","Adventure,Space Sim,Casual,3D Platformer,3D Vision,Flight,Multiplayer,Singleplayer","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/ss_afc342a420a7166580f9922b69496a1ead836fe7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607566449,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/ss_a7a71dd261f93a22fc347fc2de83566854a4fb23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607566449,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/ss_ffba4c4ba562cb0306ca4c3537eae45cb68badbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607566449,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/ss_5c9d87f3ee18bc3054a07ccf8f1fbf90df55a826.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607566449,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411880/ss_7dec9979163ab8f80e4f15e3798a7e216cc189f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607566449","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803315/movie_max.mp4?t=1601639389,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803316/movie_max.mp4?t=1601639397,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803317/movie_max.mp4?t=1601639405,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803318/movie_max.mp4?t=1601639412"

We are building this game because our children wanted a video game where they can run around as a unicorn. Unable to find one, we decided to create it. If our kids want to run around as a unicorn, chances are other kids want to run around as a unicorn too. This isn’t Insert-Word-Here Simulator. This is a world that is being crafted with thought and care. We are continuing to develop quests, events, and activities that will keep the game fresh.

Journey with DR-32 as he jumps through portals of space and time to save her. Lost Robot is a 3D Action RPG. A real hack and slash as DR-32 searches for the princess. There are 5 levels in the game from a space lab to a distant forest in the galaxy, the portals transport you from one level to the next. DR-32 picks up as many gears as possible. He never knows if he may break down so he collects them. Our Hero: DR-32 is a little short for his taste but makes up for it in spunk. He has one goal to find the princess. He won't let anything stand in his way. His abilities include super sprinting, super sword slash and he jumps pretty well for a robot. The jumping and sword slash come naturally however with sprinting you will run out of stamina. When your stamina runs out you'll need to wait as it recharges. Our Princess: Amelia is a confident young princess. She was kidnapped by some rogue sentry robots. She waits anxiously for her captain of the guard DR-32 to save her. Our Enemies: Rogue Robots originally of the royal guard. These robots have taken the princess and now want to get rid of their old captain of the guard DR-32.

Every warrior is remembered, his stories spreading like a magician’s flame. But, what happens after the story? Where does the hero go after slaying the dragon, rescuing the damsel and freeing the people from an untold terror? No one really knows what happens to the old and retired soldiers. They listen of course, to the very far fetched stories that are passed down from mouth to mouth. Where? In the very taverns that are bustling with legends and the young at heart. After years of roaming free, slaying evil and merrymaking in halls of drink, everyone takes an arrow to the knee. They have obligations and duties but most of all, the retired life is boring and redundant. They miss the dangers and wish they were young again. What better way to relive the life than to run a tavern? Travellers and adventurers from all kingdoms, far and wide come aspiring for fame and glory. They tell tales of their adventures, transforming cotton tails to horrendous beasts, morphing storms to witchery! All the danger relived in safety because at the end of the day, the warmth still burns in the fireplace. Your job is to run the tavern - Dragon's Hangover. Some will seek drinks and food while some might seek the warmth of a bed. Manage your tavern and be the host that all adventurers admire.

1206670,"Drive 4 Survival","Oct 15, 2020","0 - 20000",0,0,3.99,0,"Drive 4 Survival is a struggle for survival mostly in the frozen wilderness, where you have to rely only on yourself and your car. The goal of Early Access is simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible. We want to hear your feedback constructively and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process. Your car is an integral part of surviving in the frozen wilderness. But he requires repairs and, most importantly, enough fuel. You will have to look for the last remnants of fuel in the whole world, and sometimes it will be a fight for life. But the reward will be the opportunity to enjoy the fantastic ride and get to distant locations quickly. Always a safe place to rest, and you can also store your vehicles here. The garage can be expanded to make more space available for your vehicles, and most importantly, you will also get your small car workshop for the production of new vehicles. It is necessary to obtain spare parts for the construction of vehicles. The possibility of dismantling or selling captured vehicles at the junkyard will help you with this. For better enjoyment of long journeys in the car around the frozen world, you have available a car radio with a connection to a real online music radio station. Your travels will lead mainly to locations that have succumbed to climate change and are ruled by severe winters, bad weather, and enemies who want only one thing. And that is: make your life as uncomfortable as possible. A helicopter will help you travel between the zones. You begin the game in a relatively safe zone 'The Home - Outpost 103', which will serve as your base. And from this base, you will be able to travel for knowledge and adventure or build your home here according to your ideas. This zone is one of the last not to be affected by the winter apocalypse. But there are still other locations in the world that have not succumb to climate change but are devastated and full of danger. Like an old national park with a motel. Where the game will take you for the first time during the tutorial and where you will find the necessary spare parts to repair your car. You can return to this zone at any time and perform tasks or obtain raw materials. But beware the nights are cold and dangerous here! As soon as you put your first car into operation, you will have the opportunity to travel to the main world 'The Old World'. This is a truly inhospitable world where no rules apply. In the middle of an inhospitable world, you will be mostly alone for everything - you must not trust anyone and not forget that the world around you is your greatest enemy. With minimal initial equipment, you must first solve your basic needs and a safe haven from inclement weather and an inhospitable world. Your car will help you travel faster and a little safer and explore the world. Provide him with enough fuel and embark on a dangerous journey. Currently only part of this world is available (approx. 36km2 of 144 km2). There are many mysterious nooks and places in the world to explore from the last remnants of a civilization that have not yet been covered in snow to mysterious locations. Just like in the home zone, there is an old watchtower, which will need to be found, repaired, and then will serve as a safe haven for you. Where you will be able to plan new trips or recover here after a fight or hide from bad weather. During your travels, whether you are looking for raw materials or exploring the world. You will encounter many enemies. They have their own problems and how many times will they fight among themselves or against their main enemies. Tired of waiting at the base. So build your own house according to your ideas and fantasies. And start a new home here or just a cottage in which you will warm yourself during a long journey. You can build crop fields near your house. And in peace to grow basic crops or just settle down and try to live as a farmer. Do you just want to build and not deal with survival elements? In this case, a new Creative game mode is available to you. KEY FEATURES CARS SURVIVAL SYSTEM (food, water, fatigue, ambient and body temperature, oxygen, poison etc.) PLAYER LEVEL SYSTEM REPUTATION SYSTEM BLUEPRINTS LEARNING SYSTEM SAFE HOME ZONE SNOWY AND FOREST LOCATIONS BUILDING YOUR OWN HOME TRADE SYSTEM TASKS (TUTORIAL, BASE, REPUTATION, DAILY ETC.)

Currently the game has the following features: • assembly of a model using 29 parts • Steam Workshop support • saving the model in a simple text file and further uploading the model from there • enabling the gravity to check physical behavior of the assembled structure • changing the bolt properties (whether they are screwed on tightly or not) both in assembly of the model and with enabled gravity • removal of bolts/parts both at assembly of the model and with enabled gravity • application of a special Boltogun, capable to destroy any model • use of electric motor for rotating the part attached to it • test prototype with possibility to complete the game with it: you should assemble a model capable to overcome all obstacles and reach the finish line • bugs (well, after all, it's an early access stage) Do the parts become available gradually? Currently there are 29 parts in the game and all of them are available from the very first minute. Can I complete the game? In my opinion, the sandbox games may have no completion; however, there is a goal in the Early Access version: to reach the finish line of the test prototype. I want to ride my assembled car across vast, endless areas! Do you really believe it's exciting? This is not a race; it's a puzzle for brainstorming, not senseless moving around the same locations. (at least at Early Access stage =)) Can I connect two electric motors? Um, it seems I forgot to fix it... Are there hats in the game? No. Who are you going to put them on? On a Boltogun?

1829640,"Sigh of the Abyss: Shadow Bonds ▪ Prologue","Apr 5, 2022","0 - 0",0,0,0.0,1,"Shadow Bonds is an introduction to the world and characters of Sigh of the Abyss . You have been chained to a stranger, a boy foolish—or brave—enough to flee the gilded cage where magi are kept docile and pliant. The curse will kill you both unless you find a way to break it. Anyone else would already be dead, but not you—for you hear the ancient voice of the Abyss, and have been blessed—or cursed—with powers dark and terrible.

1767560,"Pro Cycling Manager 2022","Jun 9, 2022","20000 - 50000",270,0,39.99,0,"Pro Cycling Manager 2022 makes you a sport director. Make all the decisions necessary to take your team to the top: your responsibilities include recruitment, planning objectives and race programmes, sponsor management, scouting future talent, training, race strategy and much more. You can also create your own rider in Pro Cyclist mode. Join a team and prove you can be the leader, then do what it takes to shine in the peloton. Can you rise to become one of the best? Pro Cycling Manager 2022 lets you compete against players from around the world in online mode . WHAT'S NEW : New talent scouting system A more energetic and attacking peloton More options for customising your game experience An easier-to-use interface (new Cyclist page) Redesigned stamina and resistance system The 21 official stages of the 2022 Tour de France NEW SCOUTING SYSTEM A good sport director must know how to recruit future talent, which is why we have set up a new scouting system. You have to send your scouts to different regions in order to uncover the best talent. Your scouts become more effective and improve over time. They regularly send you information (about potential, characteristics, etc.) which you use to make your choices (observation, integration in the development team, etc.) so you can learn more about the riders. You are, of course, in direct competition with the other teams. NEW GENERATION OF RIDERS This new system is based on the level and potential of the young cyclists, using a 6-star grading system. Now the young riders who are created are juniors from 16 to 18 years old, with the pool comprised of 1,500 to 2,000 young cyclists each year (3 times more than before). These new riders will be more versatile and will develop similarly to the current stars. RIDER DEVELOPMENT Just like with the young talent, we want to have more versatile riders, so the development system has been redesigned to take this into account. It is also critical for your riders to perfectly integrate the team, establishing a good relationship with the coach, or they will not progress optimally. MORE VARIED RACE In Pro Cycling Manager 2022, thanks to a more varied peloton, you experience scenarios that are different from the usual blueprint of a Tour stage, for example. You can find yourself in a race that is action-packed from the start, with favourites taking the lead, and a variety of attacks right from the first hour. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS The interface has been redesigned, with a total overhaul of the cyclist page that now incorporates new statistics, highlighted rider capabilities and results, and the addition of an interface comparing cyclist characteristics. Stamina and resistance scores have a bigger effect on how effort is exerted during a race. This allows some riders to attack several times or manage their effort at the end of the race better. The race-day condition is now closer to the announced provisional condition. To enable comprehensive customisation, you can now adjust 2 parameters: bonus amplitude (from +5 to -5 or complete deactivation) and activation or deactivation of variation. The simulation time has been optimised and is now twice as fast as before. You can now have specific team jerseys for a given race.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Norwegian', 'Portuguese - Portugal']","['English', 'French', 'Portuguese - Portugal']","","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/header.jpg?t=1679476728","","","support@nacon.fr",True,False,False,0,"",0,566,103,"",68,415,"",0,0,0,0,"Cyanide Studio","Nacon","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Family Sharing","Casual,Racing,Sports,Strategy","Simulation,Multiplayer,Sports,Singleplayer,Management,Realistic,Strategy,Family Friendly,Racing,Competitive,Bikes,Cycling,Difficult,Artificial Intelligence,Choices Matter,Team-Based,PvP,Psychological Horror,Sci-fi,Resource Management","https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_dabc4c8e0defbb4dc1abaf96206ccd46c7635b45.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_4b306a2c2ba1cdd4cbf8771e267655eaef4caf6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_b669fb287569d3f2e6fc1393eaea3f4e3aefeb8f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_9b6cb37d2c2e82b755703eb22e3e01bedf369dd3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_7e1ee34e92cbb530526f2cf11f50f4b4407040d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_f2e8793e885e7cd8a8455b174d3f52a98c7462c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1767560/ss_8bbd7902a688ae987496ffb62cf9b6618d14c839.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679476728","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256890968/movie_max.mp4?t=1654851103,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256879283/movie_max.mp4?t=1648145015"
